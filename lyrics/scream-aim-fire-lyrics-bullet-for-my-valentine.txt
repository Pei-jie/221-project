Bullet%20For%20My%20Valentine
metal
Kill your enemies
My brothers dead around me
Wounds are hurting
Death is creeping for me
Smoke is lighting, hearts are pounding
Chaos soon ignites
The carnage made is one for all
Will I meet my Maker?
Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
The only way out is to die
God has spoken
Through His conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher
God has spoken
Through His conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher
Fuck these battlefields
The bullets shatter around me
Bodies falling
Voices calling for me
Limbs are flying, men are crying
Such a hurtful sight
The carnage made is one for all
See no prisoners
Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
The only way out is to die
God has spoken
Through His conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher
God has spoken
Through His conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher
Scream, aim, fire
Scream, aim, fire
Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
Right now it's killing time
Over the top, over the top
The only way out is to die
God has spoken
Through His conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher
God has spoken
Through His conscience
As I scream, aim and fire
The death toll grows higher
Scream, aim, fire
