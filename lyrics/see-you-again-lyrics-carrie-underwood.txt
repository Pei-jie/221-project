Ohh Ohh Ohh
Said goodbye, turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone
Faded into the setting sun,
Slipped away
But I wont cry
Cause I know I'll never be lonely
For you are the stars to me,
You are the light I follow
[Chorus:]
I will See you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
Till I see you again
Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh
I can hear those echoe's in the wind at night
Calling me back in time
Back to you
In a place far away
Where the water meets the sky
The thought of it makes me smile
You are my tomorrow
[Chorus:]
I will See you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
Till I see you again
[Bridge:]
Sometimes I feel my heart is breaking
But I stay strong and I hold on cause I know
I will see you again, ohhh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, yeah yeah
[Outro:]
I will See you again, ohhh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me,
Till I see you again
Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh
Till I see you again,
Ohh Ohh Ohh Ohh
Till I see you again,
Ohh
Till I see you again
Said goodbye turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone.
