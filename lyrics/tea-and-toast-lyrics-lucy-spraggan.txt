Tom was born in 1942
With eyes of blue
And the doctors said that his birth was far too fast
His heart stopped twice
But yet he survived
As he took his first breathe
His mother took her last
And his father knew that he wasnt to blame
But he never quite looked at Tom the same after that
And he rarely spoke about her
But when he did
He said your mother used to say this
When the skies are looking bad my dear
And your heart's lost all its hope
After dawn there will be sunshine
And all the dust will go
Skies will clear my darling
Ill wake up with the one I love the most
And in the morning, Ill make you up
Some tea and toast
When we met through a friend
Who introduced them
The first thing Tom said was "Would you like to dance?"
They moved with each other and when the music got slower
He said "Dont let go of my hand"
He said "Its only polite if I ask you tonight
Would it be alright, if I could walk you home?"
That night he told her of his birth
And said when it hurt
He thought about what his mother said about tea and toast
Two quick years they went by
They were side by side
And without a plan, they conceived a little child
He said "Women I love you and this you know
But I only have enough for our food and clothes
But I love you and this baby
Until the day that I die"
She said "Well take care of this little life
And well fall in love with her baby blue eyes
And well be alright from some advice that I know"
She said I never got to meet her
But if I did, Im sure your mother would have said this
When the skies are looking bad my dear
And your heart's lost all its hope
After dawn there will be sunshine
And all the dust will go
Skies will clear my darling
We'll show this baby all the love we know
And in the morning, Ill make you up
Some tea and toast
Well he took those words
And he made them proud
He worked day after day
And hour after hour
So they could buy a little house just on the outside of town
The little girl grew up and so did they
They said that they loved each other everyday
And forty years later, that brings us to now
And as theyre walking down the street
Her grip loosens on his hand
He puts his arm around her side as she falls to the ground
He hears her breathing and thats the only sound
Her body on the floor attracts a worried crowd
Tears roll off his face as he says Dont let go, now
And hes sitting by her bed in the hospital ward
And their daughter walks in with a family of her own
She says Dad, I dont know if she can hear you now
but theres one thing Mum would want you to know
When the skies are looking bad my dear
And your heart's lost all its hope
After dawn there will be sunshine
And all the dust will go
Skies will clear my darling
Now its time for you to let go
I'm gonna wake you up in the morning
With some tea and toast
