Well, I guess I should confess
That I am starting to get old
All the latest music fads
All passed me by and left me cold
All the kids are talking slang
I won't pretend to understand
All my friends are getting married
Mortgages and pension plans
And it's obvious my angry
Adolescent days are done
And I'm happy and I'm settled
In the person I've become
But that doesn't mean I'm settled up
And sitting out the game
Time may change a lot
But some things they stay the same
Maturity's a wrapped up
Package deal or so it seems
Ditching teenage fantasy means
Ditching all your dreams
All your friends and peers
And family solemnly tell you
You will have to grow up
Be an adult, be bored and unfulfilled
But no one's yet explained to me
Exactly what's so great about slaving
50 years away on something that you hate about
Meekly shuffling down the path of mediocrity
Well, if that's your road then take it
But it's not the road for me
And if all you ever do with your life
Is photosynthesize, then you'll deserve
Every hour of your sleepless nights
That you waste wondering when you're going to die
Now I'll play and you sing
The perfect way for the evening to begin
I won't sit down and I won't shut up
And most of all I won't 'Grow up'
