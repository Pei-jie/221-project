Love%20And%20Rockets
punk
I don't know what color your eyes are, baby
But your hair is long and brown
Your legs are strong and you're so, so long
And you don't come from this town
My head is a full of magic, baby
And I can share this with you
The feel I'm on a cross again, lately
But it's nothing to do with you
I'm alive, oh oh, so alive
I'm alive, oh oh, so alive
This drug makes me crazy
Makes me see you more clearly
Oh, baby, now I can see you
Wish I could stop, switch off the clock
Make it all happen for you
I'm alive, oh oh, so alive
I'm alive, oh oh, so alive
Don't know what color your eyes are, baby
But your hair is long and brown
Your legs are strong and you're so, so long
And you don't come from this town
My head is full of magic, baby
And I can share this with you
The feel I'm on top again, baby
That's got everything to do with you
I'm alive, oh oh, so alive
I'm alive, oh oh, so alive
