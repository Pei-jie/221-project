I thought I'd buried you and covered the tracks.
You'll have to take this with your cold dead hands.
I thought I buried you.
What's dead can never die.
I thought I'd cut you loose, severed the feeling.
I slipped through the cracks, and you caved in my ceiling.
I thought I buried you.
What's dead can never die.
Can you tell from the look in our eyes;
We're going nowhere.
We live our life like we're ready to die;
We're going nowhere.
You can run but you'll never escape.
Over and over again.
Will we ever see the end?
We're going no where.
This is sempiternal.
Will we ever see the end?
This is sempiternal.
Over and over, again and again.
Rise from the dead you say?
Secrets don't sleep 'til they're took to the grave.
Signal the sirens, rally the troops.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's the moment of truth.
Can you tell from the look in our eyes;
We're going nowhere.
We live our life like we're ready to die;
We're going nowhere.
You can run but you'll never escape.
Over and over again.
Will we ever see the end?
We're going no where.
Can you tell from the look in our eyes;
We're going nowhere.
We live our life like we're ready to die;
We're going nowhere.
You can run but you'll never escape.
Over and over again.
Will we ever see the end?
We're going no where.
This is sempiternal.
Will we ever see the end?
This is sempiternal.
Over and over, again and again.
