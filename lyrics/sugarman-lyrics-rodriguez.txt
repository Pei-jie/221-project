blues
Sugar man, won't you hurry
'cos i'm tired of these scenes
For a blue coin won't you bring back
All those colors to my dreams.
Silver magic ships you carry
Jumpers, coke, sweet mary jane
Sugar man met a false friend
On a lonely dusty road
Lost my heart when i found it
It had turned to dead black coal
Silver magic ships you carry
Jumpers, coke, sweet mary jane
Sugar man you're the answer
That makes my questions disappear
Sugar man 'cos i'm weary
Of those double games l hear
Sugar man...sugar man...sugar man...sugar man...sugar man...sugar man...sugar man...
Sugar man, won't you hurry
'cos i'm tired of these scenes
For a blue coin won't you bring back
All those colors to my dreams.
Silver magic ships you carry
Jumpers, coke, sweet mary jane
Sugar man met a false friend
On a lonely dusty road
Lost my heart when i found it
It had turned to dead black coal
Silver magic ships you carry
Jumpers, coke, sweet mary jane
Sugar man you're the answer
That makes my questions disappear
