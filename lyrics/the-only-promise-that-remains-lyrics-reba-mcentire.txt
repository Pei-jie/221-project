country
When the ground beneath you starts shaking, shaking
And you forget the place we came from, came from
When youre lost and looking for a way home
Your way home to me, I'll come out and find you
When the world around you starts moving, moving
And you should wonder if I still love you, love you
If you feel a darkness coming, rising inside
I'll make a light to guide you back home
And after all the sky has fallen down
And after all the water is washed away
My loves the only promise that remains
When your doubts have got you thinking, thinking
And nothings every really sacred, sacred
And youre afraid you might believe it
Believe in me and I'll give you a reason
Cause the world around us keeps on moving, moving
And theres no doubt that I still love you, love you
So when you feel the darkness coming, rising inside
I'll make a light to guide you back home
And after all the sky has fallen down
And after all the water is washed away
My loves the only promise that remains
My loves the only promise that remains
My loves the only promise that remains
And after all the sky has fallen down
(After all the sky has fallen down)
And after all the water is washed away
(After all the water is washed away)
My loves the only promise that remains, remains
