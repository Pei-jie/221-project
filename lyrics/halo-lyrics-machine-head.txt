This is our call to arms
Will you stand beside me?
This is our time to fight
No more compromising
And this blackened heart will sing
For sad song of charity
Halo over my demise
Following a God so blind
Shallow in their sickening
Swallow not the shit they feed, yeah
This is our right to life
Not religious right back
This is abortions knife
Aiming at the womb of
The Christian conspiracy
So open my eyes and see
The halo over my demise
Following a God so blind
Shallow in their sickening
Swallow not the shit they feed
Let's aim for
Our time will come
Our time will come
Our time is now
Our time is now
And I won't pray for you
And I won't pray for you
And I won't pray for you
Halo, follow, shallow, swallow
Halo over our demise
Following a God so blind
Shallow in their sickening
Swallow not the shit they feed
Set me free, oh
You'll never hold us down
I hope they shit on you
Satisfaction denied to run, turn and cry
Cry, turn and cry, no cry, no cry, oh
