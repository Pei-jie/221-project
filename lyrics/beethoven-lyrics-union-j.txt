pop
It feels like whisky and butterflies
Like midnight and kisses in the morning light
Waking up with you here by my side
You leave me breathless, leave me breathless, so
I'm chasing sand, do it on your skin
Rainy days are only wanna start again
I see your name and it's a violin
You leave me breathless, leave me breathless
Tonight, tonight, tonight, you are my music
Move my heart like metronome
Tonight, tonight, tonight, I wanna lose it
I'll be the only song you'll ever know
I play you like an instrument
Let me be your Beethoven
Play you like an instrument
Let me be your Beethoven
It's like we caught up in an ending string
The clocks don't tick when you hold on to me
We're keeping the rhythm so perfectly
You leave me breathless, leave me breathless
Tonight, tonight, tonight, you are my music
Move my heart like metronome
Tonight, tonight, tonight, I wanna lose it
I'll be the only song you'll ever know
I play you like an instrument
Let me be your Beethoven
Play you like an instrument
Let me be your Beethoven
'Cause tonight, tonight, tonight, you are my music
Move my heart like metronome
Tonight, tonight, tonight, I wanna lose it
I'll be the only song you'll ever know
I play you like an instrument
Let me be your Beethoven
Play you like an instrument
Let me be your Beethoven
