Oohooooh oh oooh
You're never gonna love me
So what's the use?
What's the point in playing
A game you're gonna lose?
What's the point in saying
You love me like a friend?
What's the point in saying
It's never gonna end.
You're too proud to say that you made a mistake
You're a coward to the end.
I don't wanna admit
But we're not gonna fit
No I'm not the type that you like
Why don't we just pretend?
Lies
Don't wanna know, don't wanna know, oh-e-oh-eoh
I can't let you go, can't let you go, oh-e-oh-e-oh
I just want it to be perfect
To believe it's all been worth the fight.
Lies,
don't wanna know,
don't wanna know, oh-e-oh-e-oh
You only ever touch me
In the dark.
Only if we're drinking
Can you see my spark.
And only in the evening
Could you give yourself to me.
'Cause the night is your woman
And she'll set you free.
You too proud to say that you've made a mistake
You're a coward 'til the end.
I don't wanna admit
But we're not gonna fit
No I'm not the type that you like
Why don't we just pretend?
Lies
Don't wanna know,
don't wanna know, oh-e-oh-e-oh
I can't let you go, can't let you go, oh-e-oh-e-oh
I just want it to be perfect
To believe it's all been worth the fight.
Lies, don't wanna know, don't wanna know, oh-e-oh-e-oh
Ooh, li-e-i-e-ies
Lies
Don't wanna know,
don't wanna know, oh-e-oh-e-oh
I can't let you go, can't let you go, oh-e-oh-e-oh
I just want it to be perfect
To believe it's all been worth the fight.
Lies,
don't wanna know,
don't wanna know, oh-e-oh-e-oh
