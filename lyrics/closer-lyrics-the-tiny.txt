Now I'm thinking maybe, I was stoned
I felt my feet lift off the ground
And my heart was screaming
At my bones
I need you closer
As he's in the middle of the street
Then I pretend he is mine to keep
Cars are running fast on both sides
of his head, his eyes say
Closer, closer, closer
I met him when the sun was down
The bar was closed
We both have had no sleep
My face beneath the street lamp
it reveals what it is lonely people seek
Closer, closer
Closer, closer
And you're close enough to lose
Close to the point, to where you know that your mind,
it cannot choose
Close enough to lose.
Close enough
to lose your heart
