Last night I told you I loved you, woke up, blamed it on the vodka.
I genuinely thought I was dying, then I could see that smile you were hiding.
Last night I told you I need you, thats the last time I drink tequila.
Super-Lemon and his sidekick Salt-Kid, I start crying and verbally assaulting.
Last night I asked you to marry me, thats when I remembered the brandy.
I wake up and claim I didnt say it, screwed if I ever wake up in Vegas.
Wish I could stop and Im not joking.
Drinking too much and socially smoking.
Wish I could stop, and start to behave and then wake up in the morning and never miss a day again.
Last night, police had to frisk me.
In the cells thanks to Bells fine whiskey.
I think I said too much, Like, do you like my bracelets? Oh wait, theyre handcuffs.
Last night I said I want your babies.
Forget the ice, its not nice to drink Baileys.
I drink that much that I forget.
Whatever embarrassing thing I say next.
You said I got on one knee, and theres no way
Unless Ive been drinking, oh wait, Rose!
Sailor Jerrys Rum I think I drank too much please
Showing randomers way too much, love!
Last night I called you a loser.
I think that was after flaming Sambuca.
I shouted at you, Do me a favor.
And thats when, I fell off the pavement.
Wish I could stop and Im not joking.
Drinking too much and socially smoking.
Wish I could stop, and start to behave and then wake up in the morning and never miss a day again.
Cause Id love to learn when to shut my mouth.
Wake up in the morning and be in my own house.
Do one last shot, Id know when to stop.
No more photos on Facebook of me doing the robot.
Know when to leave and when to lock my front door.
Stop waking up in trees and in a bed full of people.
Sitting in a cupboard with by weird best friend.
But Im only young so Im not going to pretend.
Wish I could stop and Im not joking.
Drinking too much and socially smoking.
I don't want to stop learn to behave.
Amen and I just missed another day again.
