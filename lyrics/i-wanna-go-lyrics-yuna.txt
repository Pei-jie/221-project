He's one in a million
I don't know when I'll be seeing him again
He wants to live in a city
Move out there when he was just seventeen, just seventeen
No I'm not prepared, no I'm not prepared
My heart's beating really fast, really fast
But I wanna go there, but I wanna go there
Lets walk a little further, you know I wanna be here
I wanna go wherever, whenever you wanna go wherever you wanna
I wanna go with you
I wanna go wherever, whenever you wanna go wherever you wanna
Can I go with you
He stares so politely
Best behaviour when he's walking with me, walking with me
He likes taking photos in black and white
They're upon his walls, on his walls
No I'm not prepared, no I'm not prepared
My heart's beating really fast, really fast
But I wanna go there, but I wanna go there
Lets walk a little further, you know I wanna be here
I wanna go wherever, whenever you wanna go wherever you wanna
I wanna go with you
I wanna go wherever, whenever you wanna go wherever you wanna
Can I go with you
I wanna go wherever, whenever you wanna go wherever you wanna
I wanna go with you
I wanna go wherever, whenever you wanna go wherever you wanna
Can I go with you
