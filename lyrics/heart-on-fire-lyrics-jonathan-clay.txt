I'm falling in
I'm falling down
I wanna begin but I don't know how
To let you know how I'm feeling
I'm high on hope, i'm winning
And I won't let you go
Now you know
I've been crazy for you all this time
I've kept it close
Always hoping
With a heart on fire
A heart on fire
with a heart on fire
a heart on fire
Hand in hand
Sparkling eyes
The days are bright
And so are the nights
Cause when i'm with you I'm grinning
Once i was screwed now i'm winning
I won't let you go
Now you know
I've been crazy for you all this time
I've kept it close
Always hoping
With a heart on fire
A heart on fire
With a heart on fire
A heart on fire
Let me walk through life with you
Everybody dreams of having what we do
Like a growling thunder
You pull me out from under
No I won't let you go
Now you know
I've been crazy for you all this time
I've kept it close
Always hoping
With a heart on fire
A heart on fire
With a heart on fire
A heart on fire
A heart on fire
