Uhh uhh uhh
It was all a dream
Last night I had a dream
Thoughts was racin' through my head
(It was all a dream)
Felt so real to me
This is what was said
"Had a dream", I said, "'Bout who?", he said
"'Bout B.I.G.", I said, "That's big", he said
"Dig what", he said, "Proceed" he said
"Indeed", I said, so, breathe I did
"Don't repeat what I say", I said, he said nothin'
He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
What I believe to be a yes I repeated what was said
It came to me like a, well, as even I said
"You feel playboy", was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know, what's the reason he was dead?
"More money, more problems, better believe it", he said
"Careful what you wish for you might receive it", he said
"I see", I said, "Jealousy", I said
"Got the whole industry mad at me", I said
Then B.I. said, "Hov' remind yourself
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself"
"I agree", I said, "My one of a kind self
Get stoned every day like Jesus did"
"What he said", I said, "Has been said before"
"Just keep doin' your thing", he said, "Say no more"
Was it all a dream
(Tell me)
Was it all a dream
(Was it a dream)
Was it all a dream
(I gotta know)
Was it all a dream
(Was it a dream)
Was it all a dream
(A dream)
Was it all a dream
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday, "Rap Attack", Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed and bamboo, sippin' on private stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? 'Duh-ha, duh-ha'
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good
Uhh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Was it all a dream
(Tell me)
Was it all a dream
(Was it a dream)
Was it all a dream
(I gotta know)
Was it all a dream
(Was it a dream)
Was it all a dream
(A dream)
Was it all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all
It was all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all a dream
