{Nick}
Yeah
{Taylor}
We were both young, when I first saw you, I close my eyes and the flashback starts.
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.
I see the lights; see the party, the ball gowns, I see you make your way through the crowd.
You say hello, little did I know...
{Nick}
We were young and times were easy
But I could see it's not the same
I'm standing here but you don't see me
I'd give it all for that to change
{Taylor}
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles, and my daddy said "stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase begging you, "Please don't go..."
And I said...
{Taylor}
Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.
{Nick}
Flooded with all this pain,
Knowing that I'll never hold her,
Like I did before the storm
{Taylor}
So I sneak out to the garden to see you, We keep quiet, because we're dead if they knew.
So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while.
{Nick & Miley}
Not a word is left unspoken,
as the thunder starts to crash
{Taylor}
And I said...
Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.
Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult, but it's real.
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
It's a love story, baby, just say yes.
I got tired of waiting.
Wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading-
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting, for you but you never come.
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think.
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...
{Nick & Miley}
Leave me alone
{Taylor}
Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.
I love you, and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad -- go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby just say... yes.
{Miley}
yeah
{Taylor}
'cause we were both young when I first saw you
