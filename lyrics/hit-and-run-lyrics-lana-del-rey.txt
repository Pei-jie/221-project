Mister Major
Then there's me little queen of the stage
He's a god won the stars call Creator
Hail the king of the Industry Players
Take off your business suit
Sittin' in your lap for my interview
Hit & Run
Let's Hit & Run
Hit & Run
Hit & Run
Baby Hit & Run
Hit & Run
Pick me up
In your white Lamborghini
London town you'll watch out
While I'm singing
Glamorise on the stage
Boy believe me
Keep your girl back no competing
Eyeing you from across the room
Watching me, wa-watching you
Hit & Run
Let's Hit & Run
Hit & Run
Hit & Run
Baby Hit & Run
Hit & Run
You & Me
On a spree
Takin' over
Wanna be your soldier
Hit & Run
Baby Hit & Run
Hit & Run
You know this world is mean
Nothing for free,
It's money and technology
Together we'd be dead or late
You know this world is mean
Nothing for free,
It's money and technology
Together we'd be dead or late
Dead or late, dead or late

You & Me
On a spree
Takin' over
Wanna be your soldier
