blues
After you've gone and left me crying
After you've gone, there's no denying
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had
There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time, when you'll regret it
Some day when you'll grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away
After Im gone, after we break up
After Im gone, youre gonna wake up
You will find you were blind
To let somebody come and change your mind
After the years weve been together
Thought joy and tears, all kinds of weather
Someday blue and downhearted
Youll long to be with me right back where you started
After Im gone, after Im gone away
You will find you were blind
To let somebody come and change your mind
Someday blue and downhearted
Youll long to be with me right back where you started
After Im gone, after Im gone away
Youll feel blue and youll feel sad
Youll miss the dearest pal you've ever had
Someday when you'll grown lonely
Your heart will break like mine and youll want me only
After youve gone, after youve gone away
You made and blue
But now Im through with you
And theres nothing more you can say
So jack be on your way, miss Ellas okay
