(Uh uh uh)
I was thinking about her
Thinking bout me
Thinkin bout us (us)
What we gonna be?
Open my eyes, (Yeah)
it was only just a dream...
So I travel back (uh)
down that road (road)
Will she come back? (Uh)
No one knows
I realize (Yeah)
It was only just a dream.
I was at the top and now its like I'm in the basement
Number 1 spot, Now she find her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it
Knowing somebody's got my baby
Now you ain't around, baby I can't think
I shoulda put it down, shoulda got that ring
Cuz I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair
My love of my life, my shawty, my wife
She left me, Im tied.
Cuz I knew that it just ain't right
I was thinking about her
Thinking bout me
Thinkin bout us (us)
What we gonna be?
Open my eyes, (Yeah)
it was only just a dream...
So I travel back (Uh)
Down that road (Yeah)
Will she come back? (back)
No one knows
I realize (Yeah)
It was only just a dream.
When I be ridin' man I swear I see your face at every turn
Trying to get my usher on but I can't let it burn
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn for
More and more, I miss her, when will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love
I guess now I got my payback
Now i'm in the club thinking all about my baby
HEY, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it everytime that I'm alone
And now I'm wishin' she'd pick up the phone
But she made a decision that she wanted to move on
Cause I was wrong.
I was thinking about her
Thinking bout me
Thinkin bout us (us)
What we gonna be?
Open my eyes, (Yeah)
it was only just a dream...
So I travel back (Uh)
Down that road (road)
Will she come back? (back)
No one knows
I realize (Yeah)
It was only just a dream...
If you ever loved somebody, put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody, put your hands up
And now they're gone and you wishin' you could give them everything
