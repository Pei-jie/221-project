[Timbaland:]
Hey girl,
I bet you I'll talk you right out out of them drawers
I bet you I'll talk you right out out of them drawers
I bet you I'll sing you right out out of them drawers
Hey JT, sing that shit, as I cut to pause.
[Justin Timberlake:]
I was a boxer til I knocked that out
I played a doctor til I made that house call
I had a shy little quiet girl but now she sings opera, loud
But my train is on yo track now
So watch out
With the music and the lights in the middle of the night
Im gettin my way like a kid in a candy store
I think you got what I want
And by the end of the night when you hot like a light,
In the beat cause you and me burned up the floor
And if you own what I want, then you already know
Help me Im going down
Thats what I hear her say
Baby my body count
Is blowing up all the way, hey
Sign up, put your name down
Make my body count
Make my body count
Make my body count

With the music and the lights in the middle of the night
