I hope you find what you're lookin for when it all comes runnin down
I hope you find it painted black on your window, or the lips of your lovers frown
Cuz if it dies in cold, when the clouds start to roll.
Is it then that your soul, starts to bleed?
Have you ever seen the President who killed your wounded child?
Or the man that crashed your sisters plane claimin he was sent of god?
And when she died in your arms, late that night in the dark,
did you pray to your God to come home?
Cuz it ain't fair to say, that these tracks are the same.
Chorus:
So god if you can hear me crash this train
said god if you can hear me crash this train.
Now a note to the President, and the Government, and the judges of this place.
We're still waitin for you to bring our troops home, clean up that mess you made.
Cuz it smells of blood and money and oil across the Iraqi land.
But its so easy here to blind us with your "United We Stand"
And it ain't hard to see that this Country ain't free.
Chorus:
So god if you can hear me crash this train
said god if you can hear me crash this train.
To the mothers and the fathers who done the best they could.
Raisin youngins in a messed up world, it ain't so understood.
So I'll cover my ears, and my eyes, pretend that loves the same.
Cuz with one courts signature, it all becomes erased.
And it ain't hard to tell,
when its love we sell.
Chorus:
So god if you can hear me, crash this train
Said god if you can hear me crash this train.
God if you can hear me crash this train.
I said God if you can hear me crash this train.
