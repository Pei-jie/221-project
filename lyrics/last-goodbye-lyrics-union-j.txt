We burn so bright before the fall
Engines slowing to a crawl
We have it all
So why are we waiting?
'Cause even though it's hard to hold
No, we just can't let it go
Away, so stay
Keep this light from fading
Damn we always hurt the ones we love
We hurt the ones we love, we love, we love
But it doesn't mean that you and I should be alone tonight
Should be alone tonight, tonight, tonight
Save the last goodbye for me
One more shiny memory
Always remember
I'll be the light on for you, for you
Save the last goodbye for me
