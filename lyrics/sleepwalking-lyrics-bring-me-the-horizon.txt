Bring%20Me%20the%20Horizon
metal
My secrets are burning a hole through my heart
And my bones catch a fever
When it cuts you up this deep
It's hard to find a way to breathe
Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper
Shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe
Time stood still
The way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole I dug
It's like I'm sleepwalking
I'm at the edge of the world
Where do I go from here?
Do I disappear?
Edge of the world
Should I sink or swim?
Or simply disappear?
Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper
Shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe
Seeing as time stood still
The way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole I dug
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Wake up!
Take my hand and
Give me a reason to start again
Wake up!
Pull me out and
Give me a reason to start again
Time stood still
(Time stood still)
Time stood still
(Time stood still)
Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper
Shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe
Time stood still
The way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole I dug
It's like I'm sleepwalking
(It's like I'm sleepwalking)
(It's like I'm sleepwalking)
Time stood still
The way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
