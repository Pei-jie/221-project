Somethin' filled up
My heart with nothin'
Someone told me not to cry
Now that I'm older
My heart's colder
And I can see that it's a lie
Children wake up
Hold your mistakes up
Before they turn the summer into dust
now children don't grow up
Our bodies get bigger
But our hearts get torn up
We're just a million
Little God's willin' rainstorms
Turnin' every good thing to rust
I guess we'll just have to adjust
With my lighnin' bolts a glowin'
I can see where I am goin' to be
When the reaper, reaches out
And touches my hand
With my lighnin' bolts a glowin'
I can see where I am goin'
With my lighnin' bolts a glowin'
I can see where I am go, goin'
You'd better look out below
