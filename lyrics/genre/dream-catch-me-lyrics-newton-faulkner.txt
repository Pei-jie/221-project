Every time I close my eyes it's you
And I know now who I am
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And I know now
There's a place I go when I'm alone
Do anything I want, be anyone I wanna be
But it is us I see and I cannot believe I'm falling
That's where I'm going, where are you going?
Hold it close, won't let this go
Dream, catch me, yeah
Dream, catch me when I fall
Or else I won't come back at all
You do so much but you don't know it's true
And I know now who I am
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And I know now
There's a place I go when I'm alone
Do anything I want, be anyone I wanna be
But it is us I see and I cannot believe I'm falling
That's where I'm going, where are you going?
Hold it close, won't let this go
Dream, catch me, yeah
Dream, catch me when I fall
Or else I won't come back at all
See you as a mountain, a fountain of God
See you as a descant soul in the setting sun
You as a sound just as silent as none
I'm yours
There's a place I go when I'm alone
Do anything I want, be anyone I wanna be
But it is us I see and I cannot believe I'm falling
There's a place I go when I'm alone
Do anything I want, be anyone I wanna be
But it is us I see and I cannot believe I'm falling
That's where I'm going, where are you going?
Hold it close, won't let this go
Dream, catch me, yeah
Dream, catch me when I fall
Or else I won't come back at all
