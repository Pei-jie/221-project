[Drake - Verse 1]
I could bet all of the riches that I ever had
Rushing the night like a shark babe
Would it be bad
If I had to set the alarm
Cus those thrills that run up my back
You are my star
Nothing else could lead me off track
Hey, yeaaaah
You're like a wildfire
You got me rising high
You're innocence
Whose the brave
Drowning in
Would you save me?
It's a crime
If you don't
You're the spy
By the throat
Hey! What's up, real nigga doing real stuff
Get a lot of money, you could never get enough
And you know the new shit sounds so tough
So and so just walked on, so what?
I don't really vibe with a lot of these niggas
I aint really into giving more than one chance, girl
I already tried with a lot of these niggas
F-ck that, that team dont know real, whats that?
That can't be from here
That can't be what they believe in, is the best shit of the year
Thats that fake shit, thats that fake shit
That that top row of veneer
Just when they getting impatient
When I make a World premiere
Uh, damn, word, Award shows coming
Make sure you spell that shit right
Make sure they give me all the credit I deserve
Make sure the good stuff's still in that Sprite
They watch us make that shit into a song
Ya aint livin' that boy stop stealin' that life
Anything could happen when I do see ya
Guess it all depends on how I'm feelin' that night
Okay, live my life in hotels
Bitch better have my room right
If they kill me, bury me a legend
Bitch better have my tomb right
Ahh, this is perfect for the women that I love before
I love em all, I just love me more
I could bet all of the riches that I ever had
Rushing the night like a shark babe
Would it be bad
If I had to set the alarm
Cus those thrills that run up my back
You are my star
Nothing else could lead me off track
Oh!
I could bet all of the riches that I ever had
Rushing the night like a shark babe
Would it be bad
If I had to set the alarm
Cus those thrills that run up my back
You are my star
Nothing else could lead me off track
Woooooh
You're like a wildfire
You got me rising high
You're innocence
Whose the brave
Drowning in
Would you save me?
It's a crime
If you don't
You're the spy
By the throat.....
