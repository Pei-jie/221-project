blues
I want you the right way, I want you but I want you to want me too
Want you to want me, baby, just like I want you
I give you all the love, I want in return, sweet darlin'
But half of love is all I feel
It's too bad, it's just too sad, you don't want me now
But I'm gonna change your mind, someway, somehow, oh baby
I want you the right way, I want you but I want you to want me too
I want you to want me, baby, just like I want you
This one way love is just a fantasy, oh sugar
To share is precious, pure an' fair
Don't play with somethin', you should cherish for life, oh baby
Don't you wanna care, ain't it lonely out there
I want you the right way, I want you but I want you to want me too
I want you to get down, baby, when I get down with you
I want you the right way, baby
I want you, baby, but I want you to want me too, baby
Want you to want me, baby, just like I want you
