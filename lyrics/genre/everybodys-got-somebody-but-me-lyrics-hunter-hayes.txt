I wish the couple on the corner would just get a room
Seems like everyone around me's on their honeymoon
I'd love to take a pin to a heart-shaped balloon
Everybody's got somebody but me
Well I don't know how I landed on this movie set
It's like the casting call for 'Romeo and Juliet'
I never would have noticed if we'd never met
But everybody's got somebody but me
And I miss you
Without you, I just don't fit in
I know we're through
But I'm wishin' we could try it again
I hear love songs playin' on the radio
People slow dancin' everywhere I go
Well, I'm a good slow dancer
But you'd never know
'Cause everybody's got somebody but me
Yeah, they do
Everybody's
Got Somebody
And I miss you
Without you, I just don't fit in
I know we're through
But I'm wishing we could try it again
Sittin' here lonely at a table for two
Watchin' lovers bein' lovers
In the corner booth
Seems like even Cupid don't know
What to do
Everybody's got somebody but me
Yeah, I don't know if I'll ever find another you
But everybody's got somebody but me
Everybody's
Got Somebody
Oh,
Everybody
Everybody
Everybody but me, now
Repeat x3 Everybody's(Everybody's) Got Somebody (Got Somebody) Everybody but me
I miss you, baby
Everybody's Got Somebody But Me
