pop
Love gone, we're falling down
But I'm loving how it tastes
I look around for desire, love run away
Hold back, we're falling out
And I'll show you how it breaks
If I can give it or take it, all of the way
And I've got a lot left to learn, babe
You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
It's hard times when nobody wants you
Fill up my cup, don't ever stop coming
Get up on top, we'll make it pop, honey
You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
S'a cold heart, when nobody holds you
Fill up my cup, don't ever stop coming
Get up on top, we'll make it pop, honey
I can't start coming down
I was way above the pace
I waited up for the day
Now the day comes to me
When I look back
We're falling out
I knew that it would break
You'd always give it, I'd take it, all the way
Hey, yeah
We've still got so much to learn, babe
You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
It's hard times when nobody wants you
Fill up my cup, don't ever stop coming
Get up on top, we'll make it pop, honey
You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
S'a cold heart, when nobody holds you
Fill up my cup, don't ever stop coming
Get up on top, we'll make it pop, honey
Don't you stop me
(Don't you stop me)
I will get what's coming to me
(I will get what's coming to me, baby)
I am ready, baby
I will be somebody
Don't you stop me
(Don't you stop me)
I will get what's coming to me
(I will get what's coming to me, baby)
I am ready, baby
I will be somebody!
You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
It's hard times when nobody wants you
Fill up my cup, don't ever stop coming
Get up on top, we'll make it pop, honey
You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
S'a cold heart, when nobody holds you
Fill up my cup, don't ever stop coming
Get up on top, we'll make it pop, honey
