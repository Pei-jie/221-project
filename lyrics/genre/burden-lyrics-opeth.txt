Opeth
metal
I once upon a time
Carried a burden inside
Some will ask, goodbye
A broken line but underlined
There's an ocean of sorrow in you
Sorrow in me
Saw a movement in their eyes
Said, I no longer knew the way
Given up the ghost
A passing minds and it's a fear
In the wait for redemption ahead
Waiting to fail
Failing again
If death should take me now
Count my mistakes and let me through
Whisper in my ear
You've taken more than we've received
And the ocean of sorrow is you
