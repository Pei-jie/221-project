Ohhhhhh
Let me down easy, let me down easy, woah, before you go
Ohh, let me down easy, let me down easy, woah, before you go
Ba ba ba ba-da da ba ba ba [x4]
[Verse 1:]
Night and day I've been doin' the math
To calculate where we wandered off track
But I know that this love was never easy
But something's faded inside of your heart
So you're crusadin' to tear us apart
It's clear now, I know you're gonna leave me
So disappear now, I won't get in your way
[Chorus:]
Ohh, let me down easy, let me down easy, woah, before you go [x2]
[Verse 2:]
Well how do I begin to convince you to love me
When you're a star in the sky up above me
And I'm too far down below
Your heavy heart has taken its toll
You've lost all the magic inside of your soul
So sell me a lie before you hit the road
[Chorus:]
Ohh, let me down easy, let me down easy, woah, before you go
Ohh, let me down easy, let me down easy, woah, before you go
[Bridge:]
Woah Yeah!
Cause I know you'd rather run than stay and try
(Ba ba ba ba-da da ba ba ba)
Cause I know it's not much easier to say good bye
(Ba ba ba ba-da da ba ba ba)
Yes I know, so if you've made your mind
Take what you want and get out of my life
But can you do this one last thing?
Leave me with my pride
[Chorus:]
Ohh, let me down easy, let me down easy, woah, before you go [x2]
Night and day I've been doin' the math
(Ohh)
To calculate where we wandered off track
(Let me down easy)
But I know, this love was never easy
(Let me down easy, woah, before you go)
Something's fading inside of your heart
(Ohh)
So you're crusading to tear us apart
(Let me down easy)
It's clear now, I know you're gonna leave me
(Let me down easy)
So disappear now, I won't get in your way
(Woah, before you go)
