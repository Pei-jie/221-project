Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh-eh.
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade.
Wish I could make it better.
Someday you won't remember this pain you thought would last forever and
ever.
Chorus:
There you'll stand, 10 feet tall.
Unafraid - I knew it all along.
Your eyes, wider than distance.
This love is sweeter than fiction.
There you'll stand next to me.
And all I was, the rest is history
Your eyes, wider than distance.
This love is sweeter than fiction.
I'll be one of the many saying,
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I'll be one of the many saying,
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I'll be one of the many saying you've made us proud, you've made us proud.
and when they cry your name
and they put your picture in a frame
You'll know that I'll be there in time & again
coz I love you then...
When you hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
let the song, let the song you heard once more
Now it's like a perfect weather...
It's like we don't remember the rain you thought would last forever and
ever
Chorus:
There you'll stand, 10 feet tall.
Unafraid - I knew it all along.
Your eyes, wider than distance.
This love is sweeter than fiction.
