blues
When I was young I was told
Try to be just as good as gold
Fly right child walk that line
Keep it straight and youll be just fine
Well, they didnt have to worry
About a thing Id do
But youre the kind of trouble
I could get into
People say you cant be tamed
Youre in the heart breakers hall of fame
Got em all standing in line
Yeah, I can read the warning signs
Its a danger zone
That Im traveling through
And youre the kind of trouble
I could get into
Youre the kind of trouble
Thats hard to resist
Id hate to think about
All the fun Id miss
Ive heard the rumors
And I hope theyre true
'Cause youre the kind of trouble
I could get into
Dont drink much, cough when I smoke
Aint many rules that I ever broke
Keep to myself, lead a real quiet life
Dont stay out too late at night
They say I aint a wild one
But if they only knew
Youre the kind of trouble
I could get into
Youre the kind of trouble
I could get into
Youre the kind of trouble
I could get into
Youre the kind of trouble
I could get into
Youre the kind of trouble
I could get into
