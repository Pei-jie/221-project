(Bridge)
Sound's a calm, when we become the animals that we're made in the jungle
(Verse)
Why you're standing so far away?
Running men is looking on, why
Why don't you come out and play?
And get closer to your animal, inside
(Pre-Hook)
Baby I act like the gentleman that your mama would love, ooh get to know me
Baby you act like a lady, don't have to cover it up, things you wanna show me
Make me remember the reason why I wanted your love, please me slowly
I think you're ready to try, walk a little closer and...
(Hook)
Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Fall in and tear off your hide, don't talk
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
(Verse)
Show me your teeth and then spread your wings
Down and dirty, you're loving me so loud
You play it brief, but you wild as a stray
Side show in front of the whole crowd
(Pre-Hook)
Baby I act like the gentleman that your mama would love, ooh get to know me
Baby you act like a lady, don't have to cover it up, things you wanna show me
Make me remember the reason why I wanted your love, please me slowly
I think you're ready to try, walk a little closer and...
(Hook)
Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Fall in and tear off your hide, don't talk
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
(Bridge)
Sound's a calm, when we become the animals that we're made in the jungle
Give it to me now
(Interlude)
Deep in that jungle where the creatures live
The animal comes out when it hears the sound of the beast
They pull off their skins so you can really see
That you're dealing with a whole new breed
(Hook)
Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Fall in and tear off your hide, don't talk
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Sound's a calm
Give it to me now
Sound's a calm
Give it to me now
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
