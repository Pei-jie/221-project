Tank
metal
Turn down the lights, turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me, tell me no lies
Just hold me close, don't patronize, don't patronize
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and feel the power
If you want, no, you won't
I'll close my eyes then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
Morning will come and I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and feel the power
If you want, no, you won't
I can't make you love me, no, if you don't
Say you ain't got love, you ain't got love
You ain't got loving
I can't just make you love me
(I can't make you love me)
I can't, I can't, I can't, now
(I can't do it)
I can't, I can't, I can't, now
(I've tried my best)
I can't, I can't, I can't, now
(But you put my heart to the test)
I can't just make you love me
(Oh, I tried)
I can't, I can't, I can't, now
(I tried to get through to you girl)
I can't, I can't, I can't, now
(Oh, can't you see that I'm crying out to you, girl?)
I can't, I can't, I can't, now
I can't just make you love me
(I can't make you love me, oh, if you don't)
