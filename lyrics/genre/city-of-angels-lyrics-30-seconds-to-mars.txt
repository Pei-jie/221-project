There was truth.
There was consequence against you -
A weak defense, then there's me;
I'm seventeen and looking for a fight.
All my life
I was never there;
Just a ghost
Running scared.
Here, our dreams aren't made - they're won.
Lost in the City of Angels;
Down in the comfort of strangers, I...
Found myself in the fire burned hills,
In the land of a billion lights.
Bought my fate
Straight from hell.
Second sight
Has paid off well for a mother, a brother and me.
The silver of a lake at night;
The hills of Hollywood on fire;
A boulevard of hope and dreams;
Streets made of desire.
Lost in the City of Angels;
Down in the comfort of strangers, I...
Found myself in the fire burned hills,
In the land of a billion lights.
I found myself in the fire burned hills,
In the land of a billion lights.
(Of a billion lights, of a billion lights, of a billion lights...)
Angels
Angels
I am home!
Home!
Home!
Home!
Lost in the City of Angels;
Down in the comfort of strangers, I...
Found myself in the fire burned hills,
In the land of a billion lights.
One life, one love - Live!
One life, one love - Live!
One life, one love - Live!
One life, one love -
