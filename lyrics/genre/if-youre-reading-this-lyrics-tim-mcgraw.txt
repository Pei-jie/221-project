If youre reading this, my momma's sitting there
Looks like I only got a one-way ticket over here
I sure wish I could give you one more kiss
And war was just a game we played when we were kids
Well Im laying down my gun, Im hanging up my boots
Im up here with God and were both watching over you
So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed that it would go
If youre reading this Im already home
If youre reading this half way around the world
I wont be there to see the birth of our little girl
I hope she looks like you, I hope she fights like me
And stands up for the innocent and the weak
Im laying down my gun, Im hanging up my boots
Tell dad I dont regret that I followed in his shoes
So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed that it would go
If youre reading this Im already home
If youre reading this theres gonna come a day
When you move on and find someone else and thats okay
Just remember this Im in a better place
Where soldiers live in peace and angels sing "Amazing Grace"
So lay me down
In that open field out on the edge of town
And know my soul
Is where my momma always prayed that it would go
If youre reading this, if youre reading this Im already home
