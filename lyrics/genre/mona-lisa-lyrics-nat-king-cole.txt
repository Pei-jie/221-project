Mona Lisa, Monalisa, men have named you
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only 'cause you're lonely, they have blamed you
For that Monalisa strangeness in your smile?
Do you smile to tempt a lover, Monalisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
Are you warm, are you real, Monalisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art?
Do you smile to tempt a lover, Monalisa?
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
Are you warm, are you real, Monalisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art?
Monalisa, Monalisa
