Am I crazy or am I blind?
Someone told me Im out my mind,
Ohhhhhh,
Someone told me a girl I liked,
Fell in love and all I did was cry,
Ohhhhhh,
Someone hold me, Im done with this game,
Said Im sorry, but i'm not to blame, What a shame,
Ohhhhhh,
Tried to break from this lonely pain,
Someone told me Im just insane,
Ohhhhhh,
Broke my heart when I knew,
That I could never be with you,
Ohhhhhh,
Someone love me, but not today,
Would you show me? Show me a way, how to love,
Ohhhhhh,
Someone told me a girl I liked,
Fell in love and all did was cry,
ohhhhhh
