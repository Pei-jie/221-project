Trough the milky way
In my Spaceship, at the speed of light I'm gonna make it
I know you've been expecting me, turn on the camera's take another scene
We go like hands up people get with the show, we're taking over people lose control
That's my DJ reaching my soul, and for the stars my people we never fall
Yes I'm an alien when I'm touching the earth
Call me a spaceman when I travel universe
Yes I'm an alien when I'm touching the earth
Call me a spaceman when I travel universe
Call me a spaceman 5x
