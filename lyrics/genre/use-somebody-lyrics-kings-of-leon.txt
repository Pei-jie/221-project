(Oh-Whoa-Oh, Oh-Whoa-Oh)
(Oh-Whoa-Oh, Oh-Whoa-Oh)
(Oh-Whoa-Oh, Oh-Whoa-Oh)
(Oh-Whoa-Oh, Oh-Whoa-Oh)
I've been roaming around, always looking down, at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you, and all you know, and how you speak
Countless lovers undercover of the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you
(Oh-Whoa-Oh, Oh-Whoa-Oh)
(Oh-Whoa-Oh, Oh-Whoa-Oh)
(Oh-Whoa-Oh, Oh-Whoa-Oh)
(Oh-Whoa-Oh, Oh-Whoa-Oh)
Off in the night, while you live it up I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you notice
Someone like me (Oh-Whoa-Oh, Oh-Whoa-Oh)
Someone like me (Oh-Whoa-Oh, Oh-Whoa-Oh)
Someone like me, somebody (Oh-Whoa-Oh, Oh-Whoa-Oh)
(Go and let it out, go and let it out)
(Go and let it out, go and let it out)
(Go and let it out, go and let it out, go and let it out)
(Oh-Whoa-Oh, Oh-Whoa-Oh)
Someone like you, somebody (Oh-Whoa-Oh, Oh-Whoa-Oh)
Someone like you, somebody (Oh-Whoa-Oh, Oh-Whoa-Oh)
Someone like you, somebody (Oh-Whoa-Oh, Oh-Whoa-Oh)
I've been roaming around, always looking down, at all I see
