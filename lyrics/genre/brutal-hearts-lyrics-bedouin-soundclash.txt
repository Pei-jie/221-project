Are you the Brutal Heart
Are you the Brutal Heart that I've been looking for
Cause if you're looking for love, you can look for that door
Hearts
Hearts that break the night in two
And arms that can't hold you that true
So useeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee me
So useeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee me
I don't mind at all
I don't mind that you only call me when you want
And Im just glad you want me at all
Hearts
And hearts that break the night in two
And arms that can't hold you that true
So useeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee me
So useeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee me
So are we Brutal Hearts
Are we Brutal Hearts that break the nigh in two
Because I just want this night with you
Well I don't like the man
I don't like the man that I am
I just want this night with you
Well then lets take this night from black to blue
Well then lets take this night from black to blue
So useeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee me
So useeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee me
