Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Nobody knows but Jesus
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Glory, Hallelujah
Sometimes I'm up, sometimes
I'm down, ohh, yes Lord
Sometimes I'm almost
To the ground, oh yes, Lord
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Nobody knows but Jesus
Anybody knows the trouble I've seen
Glory, Hallelujah
If you got there before
I do, oh yes Lord
Tell all my friends, I'm
Coming too, oh yes Lord
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Nobody knows but Jesus
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Glory, Hallelujah
Although you see me
Goin' on so, oh yes
I have my trials, here below
Ohh yes, Lord
Oh, nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Nobody knows but Jesus
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
Glory, Hallelujah
Ohh, glory, Hallelujah
