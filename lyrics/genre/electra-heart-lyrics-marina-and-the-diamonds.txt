I'm Electra
I'm Electra Heart
Only living in the dark
Lights they blind me
Can we go back, go back to the start
Where the Holy Father made His mark?
Lights they blind me
Can we go back?
For forgiveness you could always pray
That the sickness, it could go away
Lights they blind me
At the altar would you pay the price?
Would you give, would you give your life?
Lights they blind me
For forgiveness
Lights they blind me
