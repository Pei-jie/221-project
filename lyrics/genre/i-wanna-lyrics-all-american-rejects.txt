I never thought that I was so blind
I can finally see the truth, it's me for you
Tonight you can't imagine that I'm by your side
'Cause it's never gonna be the truth, too far for you
But can you hear me say?
Don't throw me away
And there's no way out
I gotta hold you somehow
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Everyday, but all I have is time
Our love's the perfect crime
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way, and when they set me free
Just put your hands on me
Take everything that I know you'll break
And I give my life away so far for you
But can you hear me say?
Don't throw me away
And there's no way out
I gotta hold you somehow
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Everyday, but all I have is time
Our love's the perfect crime
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way, and when they set me free
Just put your hands on me
Tonight I'm weak
It's just another day without you
I can't sleep
I gave away the world away for you to
Hear me say
Don't throw me away
And there's no way out
I gotta hold you somehow
All I wanna do is touch you
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Everyday, but I all I have is time
Our love's the perfect crime
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way, and when they set me free
Just put your hands on me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Everyday, but I all I have is time
Our love's the perfect crime
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna touch you
You wanna touch me too
Every way, and when they set me free
Just put your hands on me
