Jay-Z
hiphop
La, da, da, da
Hey, hey, hey
Goodbye
(Good riddance!)
Hold up, only rapper to rewrite history without a pen
No I.D. on the track, let the story begin, begin, begin
This is anti-Auto-Tune, death of the ring tone
This ain't for iTunes, this ain't for sing-alongs
This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blond
Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song
Wrong, this ain't politically correct
This might offend my political connects
My raps don't have melodies
This shit make niggas wanna go and commit felonies
Get your chain tooken
I may do it myself, I'm so Brooklyn
I know we facing a recession
But the music y'all making
Gonna make it the Great Depression
Your lack of aggression
Put your skirt back down, grow a set, men
Nigga, this shit violent
This is death of Auto-Tune, moment of silence
La, da, da, da
Hey, hey, hey
Goodbye
Hold up, only rapper to rewrite history without a pen
No I.D. on the track, let the story begin, begin, begin
Hold up, this ain't a number one record
This is practically assault with a deadly weapon
I made this just for Flex 'n Mr. Cee
I want niggas to feel threatened
Stop your blood clot crying
The kid, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
You niggas' jeans too tight
Your colors too bright, your voice too light
(That's too far nigga!)
I might wear black four years straight
I might bring back Versace shades
This ain't for Z100
'Ye told me to kill y'all to keep it 100
This is for Hot 9-7
The shit for Clue, for Khaled, for we the best in
Nigga, this shit violent
This is death of Auto-Tune, moment of silence
La, da, da, da
Hey, hey, hey
Goodbye
Hold-up, only rapper to rewrite history without a pen
No I.D. on the track, let the story begin, begin, begin
Hold up, this shit need a verse from Jeezy
(Hey!)
I might send this to the mix-tape Weezy
Get somebody from BMF to talk on it
Get this to a Blood, let a Crip walk on it
Fifty-thou to style on this
I just don't need nobody to smile on this
Y'all niggas singing too much
Get back to rap, you T-Pain-in' too much
I'm a multi-millionaire
So how is it I'm still the hardest nigga here?
I don't be in the project hallway
Talking 'bout how I be in the project all day
That sounds stupid to me
If you a gangsta, this is how you prove it to me
Nigga, just get violent
This is death of Auto-Tune, moment of silence
La, da, da, da
Hey, hey, hey
Goodbye
