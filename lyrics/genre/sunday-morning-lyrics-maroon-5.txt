Yeah oh oh oh yeah
Sunday morning rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin
And clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you, oh
That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
I'm driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
My fingers trace your every outline, oh yeah yeah
Paint a picture with my hands, oh no, no
And back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change of weather, still together when it ends, oh
That may be all I need
In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
I'm driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave, yeah
Oh oh yeah
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And Sunday morning rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing someday it will bring me back to you, yeah
Find a way to bring myself back home to you
And you may not know
That may be all, all I, all I need
Oh, in darkness she is all, all I, I see
And now come and rest your bones with me, yeah
Driving slow, driving slow
Now yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
There's a flower in your hair
And I'm a flower in your hair, oh oh
Oh yeah yeah, oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Sunday morning rain
On Sunday morning, yeah yeah
On Sunday morning, oh oh oh oh
I'll be home, I'll be
