The greatest night in history
Baby its not you, its me
What you think Im done, done babydoll
Im big enough and bad enough
And I can tell when things get rough
Now nothing that you say can break my fall
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Stop right there
Oh-oh-oh-oh
If you really care
Dont go and blow it all, its bad enough baby
I dont wanna hear you saying its not you, its me
If theres good in my hands, you just let me know
If youre gone with a dance, you should let me go
Oh, baby you said it all,
Theres nothing you can say to break my fall
Greatest fly in history,
Baby its not you, its me
Do you really think Ill buy, youll push it all
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Give a girl her self respect
You havent gone and hurt me yet
But you know that Ill crumble if you call
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Stop right there
Oh-oh-oh-oh
If you really care
Dont go and blow it all, its bad enough baby
I dont wanna hear you saying its not you, its me
If Theres blood on my hands, you just let me know
If youre gone with a dance, you should let me go
Oh, baby you said it all,
Theres nothing you can say to break my fall
Break my fall
Im not gonna let you become a martyr
Im not gonna let you pickup the gun
Im gonna make this, a whole lot harder
Wont make it easy for you to run
Im not gonna let you become a martyr
Im not gonna let you ickup the gun
Im gonna make this, a whole lot harder
Wont make it easy for you to run
Dont go and blow it all, its bad enough baby
I dont wanna hear you saying its not you, its me
If theres blood on my hands, you just let me know
If youre gone with a dance, you should let me go
Oh, baby you said it all,
Theres nothing you can say to break my fall
Dont go and blow it all, its bad enough baby
I dont wanna hear you saying its not you, its me
If theres good in my hands, you just let me know
If youre gone with a dance, you should let me go
Oh, baby you said it all,
Theres nothing you can say to break my fall
