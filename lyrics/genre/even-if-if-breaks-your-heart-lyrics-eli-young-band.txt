country
Way back on the radio dial
A fire got lit inside a bright eyed child
Every note just wrapped around his soul
From steel guitars to Memphis all the way to rock n roll
Ohh ohh
I can hear em playing
I can hear the ringing of a beat up old guitar
Ohh ohh
I can hear em singing
Keep on dreaming even if it breaks your heart
Downtown is where I used to wander
Old enough to get there but too young to get inside
So I would stand out on the sidewalk
Listen to the music playing every Friday night
Ohh ohh
I can hear em playin
I can hear the ringing of a beat up old guitar
Ohh ohh
I can hear em singing
Keep on dreaming even if it breaks your heart
Some dreams stay with you forever
Drag you round and bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on getting better
Gotta keep believing if you wanna know for sure
Ohh ohh
I can hear em playin
I can hear the ringing of a beat up old guitar
ohh ohh
I can hear em singing
Keep on dreaming even if it breaks your heart
(x2)
Keep on dreaming even if it breaks your heart
Oh oh oh
Keep on dreaming
Oh oh oh
Don't let it break your heart
