blues
You're all I need to get by
Like sweet morning dew, I took one look at you
And it was plain to see you were my destiny
With arms open wide I threw away my pride
I'll sacrifice for you, dedicate my life to you
I will go where you lead, always there in time of need
And when I lose my will you'll be there to push me up the hill
There's no, no looking back for us
We got love sure enough, that's enough
You're all, you're all I need to get by
You're all I need to get by
Like an eagle protects his nest, for you I'll do my best
Stand by you like a tree and dare anybody to try and move me
Darling in you I found strength where I was torn down
Don't know what's in store but together we can open any door
Just to do what's good for you and inspire you a little higher
I know you can make a man out of a soul that didn't have a goal
'Cause we, we got the right foundation and with love and determination
You're all, you're all I want to strive for and do a little more
You're all, all the joys under the sun wrapped up into one
You're all, you're all I need, you're all I need, you're all I need to get by
Oh babe, oh babe, honey, honey, honey
Yeah, I need you darlin', oh I need, oh baby
I'm better than that, all I could need, I need tonight
Oh, oh your love
