Ah yes,
Well, look at here, look at here
Ah, what do we have?
Another pretty thang ready for me to grab
But little does she know
That I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
'Cause at the end of the night
It is her I'll be holding
I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me
Baby, baby, please don't go away
But when I play, I never stay
To every girl that I meet, yeah
This is what I say
Run, run, runaway, runaway, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, getaway, getaway, darling
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause lord knows I'm a rolling stone
So you better run, run, runaway, runaway, baby
Ah yeah
Well, let me think, let me think
Ah, what should I do?
So many eager young bunnies
That I'd like to pursue
Now even now they eating out
The palm of my hand
There's only one carrot
And they all gotta share it
I love you so
That's what you'll say
You'll tell me
Baby, baby, please don't go away
But when I play, I never stay
To every girl that I meet, yeah
This is what I say
Run, run, runaway, runaway, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, getaway, getaway, darling
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause what knows I'm a rolling stone
So you better run, run, runaway, runaway, baby
See I ain't try to hurt you, baby
No, no, no, I just wanna work you, baby, yup, yup
See I ain't try to hurt you, baby
No, no, no, I just wanna work you, baby
If you scared you better run
You better run, you better run
You better, you better, you better
Run, run, runaway, runaway, baby
Before I put my spell on you
You better get, get, getaway, getaway, darling
'Cause everything you heard is true
Your poor little heart will end up alone
'Cause what knows I'm a rolling stone
So you better run, run, runaway, runaway, baby
