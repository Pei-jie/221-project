Remember boy that your forefathers died
Lost in millions for a country's pride
But they never mention the trenches of Belgium
When they stopped fighting and they were one
A spirit stronger than war was at work that night
December 1914 cold, clear and bright
Countries' borders were right out of sight
When they joined together and decided not to fight
All together now
All together now
All together now
In no man's land, together
All together now
All together now
All together now
In no man's land, together
The same old story again
All those tears shed in vain
Nothing learnt and nothing gained
Only hope remains
All together now
All together now
All together now
In no man's land, together
All together now
All together now
All together now
In no man's land, together
All together now
All together now
All together now
In no man's land, together
All together now
All together now
The boys had their say, they said no
Stop the slaughter and let's go home
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
The boys had their say, they said no
Stop the slaughter and let's go home
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go home
All together now
All together now
All together now
In no man's land, together
All together now
All together now
All together now
In no man's land, together
The boys had their say they said no
Stop the slaughter and let's go home
Let's go, let's go, let's go home
The boys had their say they said no
Stop the slaughter and let's go home
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go home
All together now
All together now
All together now
In no man's land, together
All together now
All together now
All together now
