Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better this Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together this Christmas
The fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
This Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me
Let's go
Presents and cards are here
My world is filled with cheer and you this Christmas
And as I look around
Your eyes outshine the town, they do this Christmas
The fireside is blazing bright
And were caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for me
Shake a hand, shake a hand now
Ooh, the fireside is blazing bright
Were caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
So special for you and me, yes, it will be
Shake a hand now
Come on, everybody shake a hand now
Family and well be together
To make this Christmas bright, yes, we will
