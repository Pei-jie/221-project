Ella%20Fitzgerald
blues
It don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing
It don't mean a thing, all you got to do is sing
It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm everything you've got
Oh, it don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing
It don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing
Don't mean a thing, all you got to do is sing
It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm everything you got
Oh, it don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing
It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm everything you've got
Don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing
Don't mean a thing, all you got to do is sing
Makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm everything you've got
Don't mean a thing, all you got to do is swing
It don't mean a thing, all you got to do is sing
It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Give that rhythm everything you've got
Oh, it don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing
Don't mean a thing
