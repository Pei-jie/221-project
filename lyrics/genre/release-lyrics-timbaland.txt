Oh, I need you girl
Hey, I really need you

So here the party goes
With all my Gs in the back
Who needs a bodyguard?
I think I need to
Release!

Release!
I am out of control, whos here to party?
Release!
I am out of control, Im out of body
Release!

Oh! I push, the party starts
Haters cant even see me
We came to party hard
I think I need to
Release!
I am out of control, Im out of body
Release!
I am out of control, whos here to party?
Release!
I am out of control, Im out of body
Release!
I am out of control, Im out of, wait a minute!
Who holds the party tracks!
He keeps the party going
The club is over-packed
Look, this cant wait till mornin'
Weve got a video
I think we're late for our shoot

Hey! These girls aint cute!
They want me to do my part
But first I gotta
Release!
I am out of control, Im out of body
Release!
I am out of control, whos here to party?

I am out of control, Im out of body
Release!
I am out of control, Im out of, wait a minute!
