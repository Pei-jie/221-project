hiphop
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
Everythin' you like
Everythin' you love
Everythin' you like
Everythin' you love
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
Everythin' you like
Everythin' you love
Everythin' you like
Everythin' you love
She wants that old thing back, she want those heroin tracks
She likes me, she fiends for me nightly, she leans for me
Mornin' she rush for my touch, this is about lust
Cold sweats occur when I'm not with her
My presence is a must, must, must
Bonita Applebum, I gotta put you on
If I didn't when we cuttin', the feelin' would be too strong
In any form, I'm givin' you sweet dreams
That Sugar Hill, she call me her sweet thing
That Black Rain that take away your pain
Just for one night, baby, take me in vein
Now that feelin' got you trippin', you no wanna feel no different
Said lust has got you itchin' all wide open and its' drippin'
I know what you like, I am your prescription
I'm your physician, I'm your addiction
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
Everythin' you like
Everythin' you love
Everythin' you like
Everythin' you love
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
Everythin' you like
Everythin' you love
Everythin' you like
Everythin' you love
I am so dope like Louis Vuittons with the red bottoms
You gotta have 'em, you glad you got 'em
Like every color, Giuseppe's your guilty pleasure is me
It's so much fun, you shun therapy
Although it never be, the feelin' is fleetin'
Shopping's like coppin', you constantly need it
I'm never around, you constantly seekin'
You'll never be down, I know where your peak is
9 1/2 weeks is better than 12-steps
I keep tryin' to remind you to keep tellin' yourself
Now your conscience is interfering like better yourself
Like you better get help but when that medicine's felt?
We're back together, don't ever leave me
Don't ever let 'em tell you that you'll never need me
My China White, 'til we D.O.A.
It's Montega forever, baby, let's get away
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
Everythin' you like
Everythin' you love
Everythin' you like
Everythin' you love
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
Everythin' you like
Everythin' you love
Everythin' you like
Everythin' you love
How could you leave me? I thought that you needed me
When the world got too much and you pleaded with me
Who helped you immediately? How speedy of me
How could you deny me so vehemently?
Now your body is shakin', tryin' to free it of me
And your soul is in control, tryin' to lead it from me
And your heart no longer pledge allegiance to me
Damn, I'm missin' the days when you needed the D
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
Everythin' you like
Everythin' you love
Everythin' you like
Everythin' you love
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
Everythin' you like
Everythin' you love
Everythin' you like
Everythin' you love
