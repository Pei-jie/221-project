So, if you want something
And you call, call
Then I'll come running
To fight and I'll be at your door
When there's nothing worth running for
When your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point trying to change it
When your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point trying to stop it, you see
You're just like everyone
When the shit falls
All you wanna do is run away
And hide all by yourself
When there's far from, there's nothing else
When your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point trying to change it
When your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point even talking
When your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point trying to fight it
When your mind's, your mind
Love, love
There's no point trying to change it
When your love
So if you ever want something
And you call, call
Then I'll come running
