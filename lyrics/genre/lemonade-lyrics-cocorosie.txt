Cocorosie
indie
It was Cinco de Mayo
Pillow case on his head
No more breathing time
An ambulance sped
Sped 'round every corner
Calling out his name
Shot a rabbit from the back seat window
Sat and watched the summer corn grow
Ate ice cream in a desert dream
And got lost in father's singing
Too hot inside
Too hot outside
Lazy days when I said let's go for a ride
We'd sail on Spirit Lake
Me, my pappy and his lemonade
Tim and Tina were my parents' names
They got engaged
They were inflamed
Seduced by the light of butterflies
How they shimmer, how they glimmer
Those butterflies
We seven kids
We almost died
Nearly put to death
By lightening strikes
Instead there was hot, pink
Flashes in the sky
We climbed the rocks, in snow and rain
In search of magic powers
To heal our mother's pain
Shot a rabbit from the back seat window
Sat and watched the summer corn grow
Ate ice cream in a desert dream
And got lost in father's singing
Too hot inside
Too hot outside
Lazy days when I said let's go for a ride
We'd sail on Spirit Lake
Me, my pappy and his lemonade
