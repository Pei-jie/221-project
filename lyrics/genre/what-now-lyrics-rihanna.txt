[Verse 1]
I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying, tears were for the weak the days
I'm stronger now or so I say
But something's missing
[Pre Chorus 1]
Whatever it is, it feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is, it's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
[Chorus 1]
What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now? Ohhhh what now?
[Verse 2]
I found the one he changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love
But I'm numb again
[Pre Chorus 2]
Whatever it is, it feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is, it's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
[Chorus 2]
What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now? Please tell me
What now?
[Bridge]
There's no one to call 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
The more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the emotions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout!
[Chorus 2]
What now? I just can't figure it out
What now? I guess I'll just wait it out (wait it out)
What now? somebody tell me
What now?
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know ow ow why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know ow ow why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know ow ow why
So what now?
