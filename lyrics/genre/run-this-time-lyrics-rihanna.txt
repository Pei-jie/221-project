Feel it coming in the air

Only thing thats on my mind
Is who gon run this town tonight
Is who gon run this town tonight
We gon run this town
Jay-Z
We are, yeah, I said it, we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get yall fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything
And our girls are blackbirds, riding with they Dillingers
I get more in-depth if you boys really real enough
This is La Familia, Ill explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
Im a couple bands down and Im tryna get back
I gave Doug a grip, I lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah, Im talking five comma six zeroes dot zero ?
Back to running circles round niggas, now we squared up
Hold up
Rihanna
Lifes a game but its not fair
I break the rules so I dont care
So I keep doing my own thing
Walking tall against the rain
Victorys within the mile
Almost there, dont give up now
Only thing thats on my mind
Is who gon run this town tonight
Heeeeeeeeey heeeeeeay

You can call me Caesar, in a dark Caesar
Please follow the leader, so Eric B we are
Microphone fiend, its the return of the God, peace God
And aint nobody fresher
Im in Maison, uh, Martin Margiela
On the table, screaming fuck the other side, they jealous
We got a bankhead full of broads, they got a table full of fellas
And they aint spendin no cake
They should throw they hand in, cause they aint got no spades
My whole team got dough
So my bankhead is lookin like Millionaires Row

Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This a fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for? To push a fuckin Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon want one thing
I could spend my whole life good will hunting
Only good gon come is its good when Im coming
She got an ass thatll swallow up her G-string
And up top, uh, two bee stings
And Im beasting, off the re-sling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that you do bring
Im just tryna change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoestrings?
