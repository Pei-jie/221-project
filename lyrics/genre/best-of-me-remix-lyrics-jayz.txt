I'm focused man,
Tell Stout to holla at me man
Young Hove ya heard (new Mya!)
Yes, yollin Jigga man be ballin'
Biv chicks pigeons Hove
some of them be grawlin'
Get the best of you
Whenever I put my all in
Have mamis callin' for the law, darling
Jigga and Paulin ass drop
coops with half the tops
Expose half my knot
Niggas mad when I brag 'bout the cash I got
But I'm used to not having alot
I'm from the gutta and (ah)
I ain't the type that to eva chase your box
I'm a type to interior decorate the watch
I'm a type to sling heavy weight on the block
And every state like Pac words Jiggers to hurt (holla)
(Mya:)
Ya lips are telling me yes
While you're kissing on my neck
Making me feel so...
Should I stay, should I go
I don't know
Your hot boy style, drives me wild
But in the back of my mind I know
Even thought I
I wanna see
How you put that thing on me
I can't let you best of me
(x2)
(Best of me, best of me)
Conversation ain't what?
Big thighs got you stuck
Feelings starting to show
Should I stay, should I go
I don't know
You're driving me crazy
I wanna be your lady
But I got a man at home
Even thought I
I wanna see
How you put that thing on me
I can't let you best of me
(x2)
(Let you get the best of me, the best of me, the best of me)

5-4-3-2-1
Carolina blue kits
Hottes nigga on the block
Used to wheelie bicycle since I was six
High school cross-over wave to wave pics
Music is the same shit
Gave away hits
So 'ma get it together
Forget it forever when I
go at you hard, I can
get it through leather, you
act like Jigga, can't
get at whoever
talking you got a man
okay 'ma (and...)
That's high school, making me chase you 'round for months
Have an affair, act like an adult for once
Plus my hands up your skirt
god damn you flirt
What's a little me on top gon' hurt
maybe a little but...
Pain is pleasure and pressure bust pipes
and you look like the "I like it rough" type
We can crush tonight tell me what you like
I got a yellow bottle on a bucket of ice (shit right?, Young Hova)
(Mya:)
Even thought I
I wanna see
How you put that thing on me
I can't let you best of me
(x2)
