So abruptly, saw death on a sunny snow
For every life, forgo the parable
Seek the light, my knees are cold
Running home, running home
Running home, running home
Go find another lover to bring a, to string along
For all your lies, you're still very lovable
I toured the land, so many foreign roads
For Emma
Forever ago
