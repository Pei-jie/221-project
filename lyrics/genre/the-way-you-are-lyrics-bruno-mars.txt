Intro (J. Reyez):
Alright, I do this for all of you.
I make music for love, the love of everything.
J. Reyez... Bruno Mars...
C'mon!
Verse 1 (J. Reyez):
When I wake up next to you girl
It's like a dream and I'm stuck in two worlds
You're beautiful and you're always shining
your happiness to me is worth more than diamonds
Many people are there, but you're worth keeping
the same letters, three words and one meaning
I love you, but we have our little arguments
that don't stop untill we forgot who started it
I blank out and the thoughts around in me
you and I, everytime you smiled at me
And I'm blessed, god's gift to me is you
your eyes, the world I see in you
and time never goes to waste,
don't change, cuz you can never be replaced
this love, you can never rearrange
everytime when I see your face.
Refrain (Bruno Mars):
When I see your face
there's not a thing that I would change
Cuz you're amazing
just the way you are
And when you smile
the whole world stops and stares for a while
cuz girl you're amazing
just the way you are.
Verse 2 (J. Reyez):
Just the way you express with "ing" girl
You're nothing short of my everything
And every memory so sentimental
your happiness is my essential
This a way for me to say thanks
no stress, I want you to give me strenght
when I'm hurting, you're so close to perfect
but to the world you're just one person
but to that person you mean the world is just
how we ride, me and my girl, uhh.
we do this Bonnie and Clyde shit
we fall together, we coincided
the way to my heart it was hard to find it
but you found dead deep down inside of this love
you can never rearrange,
everytime when i see your face.
Refrain (Bruno Mars):
When I see your face
there's not a thing that I would change
Cuz you're amazing
just the way you are
And when you smile
the whole world stops and stares for a while
cuz girl you're amazing
just the way you are
the way you are (x2)
girl you're amazing, just the way you are
When I see your face
there's not a thing that I would change
Cuz you're amazing
just the way you are
And when you smile
the whole world stops and stares for a while
cuz girl you're amazing
just the way you are
yeah-ahh.
