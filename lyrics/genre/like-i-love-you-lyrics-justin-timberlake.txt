Just something about you
The way I'm lookin' at you, whatever
You keep lookin' at me
You gettin' scared now, right?
Don't fear me baby, it's just Justin
It feel good right? Listen
I kind of noticed from one night
In the club, your front face
It's kind of weird to me since you're so fine
If it's up to me, you'll face no change
If you smiling, that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Just remember
Sing this song with me
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you
People are so phony, nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating, love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight
If you smiling that should set the tone
Just be limber, baby
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Baby, just remember
Sing this song with me
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you
Yeah, you know I can make ya happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance to be your man
I won't let you down, baby
If you give me that chance to be your man
Here baby, put on my jacket and then
Maybe we'll fly tonight
(I just wanna love you baby)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl
Maybe we'll fly tonight
(I just wanna love you baby)
Girl
Ma, what chu wanna do? I'm in front of you
Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
And the mall kids, that's how to change low
From them you heard, "Wow, it's the same glow"
Look at me, I say, "Yeah, it's the same dough"
We the same type, you my air of life
You have sleepin' in the same bed, every night
Go rock with me, you deserve the best
Take a few shots, let it burn in your chest
We could ride down, pumpin' N.E.R.D. in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play this free, joint called, "Brain"
Ma, take a hint, make me swerve in the lane
The name Malicious and I burn every track
Clipse and J. Timberlake, now how heavy is that?
Maybe we'll fly tonight
(I just wanna love you baby)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl
Maybe we'll fly tonight
(I just wanna love you baby)
Girl
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I
You know, I used to dream about this when I was a little boy
I never thought it would end up this way, drums
It's kind of special right? Yeah
You know, you think about it
Sometimes people just destined
Destined to do what they do
And that's what it is, now everybody dance
