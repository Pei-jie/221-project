Dear God, bring our POW's home
And bring our brothers on lock down, home, Amen
Geah, he's a nigga from the back block
On everybody laptop who used to slang crack rock
HOV' and this nigga from the Chi'
Who hold a note like the guy who said the British is comin'
My nigga Kels, oh yeah, the niggaz is comin'
Get out your good dishes or somethin' like it's Thanksgiving, nigga
It's HOV' and none other than the R
And without further adieu, like Freddie get ready it's
Whatever happen, Lord, don't send me back
And whenever I did wrong it was Your name I cried
I heard You forgave over and over again
But when I found that out I became immune to my sins
Lay wide awake in the middle of my sleep
I see dead people and sometimes it's me, Lord
I never wanted to be a Thugfather
I only wanted to be a son of a father
That's how it sounds, it's sad
Worse than the war in Iraq when it's me against I
I gave up the weed and somehow I'm still high
Three years, still seein' the weed in my eyes, Lord
Sometimes I don't know what You want from me
But I do know You know what I want from You
Give it to me c'mon, take away this Hennessey
Take away me runnin' the street
Stop people from hatin' me
Take away all of this jealousy and prejudicy
Thought You said, it was a better place
I grew up around pimps, hustlers hoes and project gangsters
Hard to believe in what I can't see
I gotta get this money and feed my family
Whatever guillotine guides my life
Dear Lord, don't let me die tonight
But if I shall before I wake what shall I say?
It's been a good run from hoodlum to Island estates
How could one, make such foul mistakes
Still be allowed to have a smile on my face?
Hell, whatever the case, I'm glad it wasn't murder
In a town you never hearda from a nickel-plated burner
Now my life's straight like a perm
Try to take the spot I earned, muh'fucker better learn
It's Hov, he's a nigga from the back block
On everybody laptop who used to slang crack rock
Kel and this nigga from the Chi'
Who hold a note like the guy who said the British is comin'
Hov, oh yeah, the niggaz is comin'
Get out your good dishes or somethin' like it's Thanksgiving, niggas
Kel and none other than the R
And without further adieu, like Freddie get ready it's
Hey boy, hear me out, got a few mo' things to say
These niggaz be chasin' me like everyday
C'mere, no, my life on crutches, devils say
I'll never walk again but the Devil is a liar 'cause I believe within
You're the reason that I'm still here
Even though I don't act like it
Even though I hear my calling and fight it
Fools do me so wrong, it's hard to stay righteous
Pimping was a mountain to heaven, I'd hike it
Believe me, Lord, I want You
Got money and fame and still it just won't do
Sometimes I don't like who I am
When I look in the mirror, my reflection is Uncle Sam
And every night I have these weird dreams
That a creature's right beside me, wake up and can't breathe
I feel like it's twenty of me
Goin' twenty different directions on a one-way street, Lord
I got houses, money and cars and that
Everything single superstar, I got the whole music industry sewed
But it still don't matter when I'm gone and my casket closed, go
Whatever guillotine guides my life
Dear Lord, don't let me die tonight
But if I shall before I wake I'd accept my fate
I did what I did my heart was in the right place
I did so I could live to put food on my plate
You musta love me not to let it end by 3 that day
Well, whatever the case, I'm glad it wasn't murder
In a town you never hearda from a nickel-plated burner
I guess I'm not finished with my journey
Please forgive me for my sins
Shit, I'm still trying to learn, meet Hov
He's a nigga from the back block
On everybody laptop who used to slang crack rock
Kel and this nigga from the Chi'
Who hold a note like the guy who said the British is comin'
Hov, oh yeah, the niggaz is comin'
Get out your good dishes or somethin' like it's Thanksgiving, niggas
Kel and none other than the R
And without further adieu, like Freddie get ready it's
[Incomprehensible]
Wrap your arms around us God
Let there be peace and no more war
And bring our soldiers home, let us pray
Hey, hey, hey
