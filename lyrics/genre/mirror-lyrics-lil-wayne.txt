Uh, With everything happening today
You don't know whether you're coming or going
But you think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror, don't blow it (Whoo!)

So why are we
Talking to each other again?
Mirror on the wall
Here we are again (yeah)
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend (any questions)
You told me that they can (I come to you)
Understand the man I am (you always have the answer)
So why are we here
Talking to each other again?
Mirror on the wall (Hey BP, looks like I did take 'em to Mars this time)
So why are we talking to each other again?
