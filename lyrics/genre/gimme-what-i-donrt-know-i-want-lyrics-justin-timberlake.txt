Sounds are calm, when we become the animals that we're made in the jungle
[Verse 1]
Why you staying so far away?
Running, men is looking on, why
Why don't you come out to play?
And get closer to your animal, inside
[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I act like the gentleman that your mother love, ooh get to know me
Baby you act like a lady, don't have to cover it up, things you wanna show me
Make me remember the reason why I wanted to love, please be slowly
I think you're ready to try, walk a little closer and...
[Chorus]
Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Fall in a terror of height, don't talk
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
(Verse 2)
Show me your teeth, and then spread your wings
Down and dirty, you're loving me so loud
Play it breeze, but you wild as a strain
Side show in front of the whole crowd
[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]
Sounds are calm, when we become the animals that we're made in the jungle
[Chorus]
Sounds are calm, when we become the animals that we're made in the jungle
[Outro]
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
