If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Uh oh uh oh
Lord make me a rainbow
I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when
She stands under my colours, oh and
Life ain't always what you think it oughta be, no
Ain't even grey, but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life,
Well, I've had just enough time
If I die young bury me in satin.
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
The sharp knife of a short life,
Well I've had just enough time
And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

The sharp knife of a short life,

Well I've had just enough (Santana with New Directions: time)
Ooh yeah
Ooh whoa
So put on your best boys and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts
Oh no, I'll sell them for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I been singin'
Funny when you're dead how people start listenin'
If I die young
Santana with New Directions:
Bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Santana (New Directions):
Uh oh (uh oh)
The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Santana with New Directions:
Gather up your tears
Santana:
Keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when your really gonna need 'em oh
Santana with New Directions:
The sharp knife of a short life
Santana:
Well I've had just enough (Santana with New Directions: time)
So put on your best boys
And I'll wear my pearls
