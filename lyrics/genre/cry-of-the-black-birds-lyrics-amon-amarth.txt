Raise your swords up high
See the black birds fly
Let them hear your rage
Show no fear, attack
Charge your horses across the fields
Together we ride into destiny
Have no fear of death when it's our time
Odin will bring us home when we die
The ground trembles under us
As we make our thunder charge
The pounding hooves spread
Panic and fear into their hearts
Our helmets shine in the sun
As we near their wall of shields
Some of them turn and run
When they hear our frantic screams
Throw your swords to
(The)
Sky
Hear the black birds cry
Let them feel your hate
Show no fear
Attack
The enemy are in disarray
Like a cowardice they run
Send them to their final graves
Don't spare anyone
Kill the wounded by order of
See the pain in their eyes
Over the field and fear the sound
As we hear the ravens cry
