Memories, memories
Memories, memories
In this world you tried
Not leaving me alone behind
There's no other way
I prayed to the Gods, let him stay
The memories ease the pain inside
Now I know why
All of my memories keep you near
In silent moments, imagine you'd be here
All of my memories keep you near
Your silent whispers, silent tears
Made me promise I'd try
To find my way back in this life
I hope there is a way
To give me a sign you're okay
Remind me again it's worth it all
So I can go home
All of my memories keep you near
In silent moments, imagine you'd be here
All of my memories keep you near
Your silent whispers, silent tears
Together in all these memories
I see your smile
All the memories I hold dear
Darling, you know I'll love you till the end of time
All of my memories keep you near
In silent moments, imagine you'd be here
All of my memories keep you near
Your silent whispers, silent tears
All of my memories
