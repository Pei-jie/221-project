Now a red solo cup is the best receptacle
For barbecues, tailgates, fairs and festivals
And you, sir, do not have a pair of testicles
If you prefer drinking from glass
A red solo cup is cheap and disposable
And in 14 years they are decomposable
And unlike my home, they are not foreclosable
Freddie-Mac can kiss my ass. Woo!
Red solo cup, I fill you up
Let's have a party, let's have a party
I love you red solo cup, I lift you up
Proceed to party, proceed to party
Now I really love how you're easy to stack
But I really hate how you're easy to crack
Cuz when beer runs down in front of my pack
Well that my friends is quite yucky
But I have to admit the ladies get smitten
Admiring how sharply my first name is written
On you with a sharpie when I get to hittin'
on them to help me get lucky
Red solo cup, I fill you up
Let's have a party, let's have a party
I love you red solo cup, I lift you up
Proceed to party, proceed to party
Now I've seen you in blue and I've seen you in yellow
But only you, red, will do for this fellow
Cuz you are the Abbot to my Costello
And you are the fruit to my loom
Red solo cup, you're more than just plastic
You're more than amazing you're more than fantastic
And believe me that I'm not the least bit sarcastic
when i look at you and say:
"Red solo cup, you're not just a cup. (No, no, God no!)
You're my, you're my (friend?) friend. (life long!)
Thank you for being my friend."
Red solo cup, I fill you up
Let's have a party, let's have a party
I love you red solo cup, I lift you up
Proceed to party, proceed to party
Red solo cup, I fill you up
Let's have a party, let's have a party
I love you red solo cup, I lift you up
Proceed to party, proceed to party
Red solo cup, I fill you up
Let's have a party, let's have a party
I love you red solo cup, I lift you up
Let's have a party, proceed to party
Red solo cup! Solo cup!
