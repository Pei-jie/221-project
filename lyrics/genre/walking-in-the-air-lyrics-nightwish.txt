Nightwish
metal
We're walking in the air, we're floating in a moonlit sky
The people far below are sleeping as we fly
I'm holding very tight, I'm riding in a midnight blue
I'm finding I can fly, so high above with you
Far across the world, the villages go by like trees
The rivers and the hills, the forests and the streams
Children gaze open mouth, taken by surprise
Nobody down below believes their eyes
We're surfing in the air, we're swimming in the frozen sky
We're drifting over ice, see mountains floating by
Suddenly swooping low on an ocean deep
Arousing of a mighty monster from its sleep
We're walking in the air, we're floating in a midnight sky
And everyone who sees us, greets us as we fly
I'm holding very, holding very tight, I'm riding in a midnight blue
I'm finding I can fly, so high above with you
