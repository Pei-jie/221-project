Yuna
indie
She thinks she's all alone
And all her hopes are gone
And so I wrote this song
So she can move along
Well, things were bad
She was in despair
Well, things were bad.
And you were never there
But things were bad
She came up for air
She said a little prayer
She found herself
Chorus:
Yeah, she's got a light in her face
She don't need no rescue and she's okay
Yeah, she's got life in her veins.
She don't need no rescue and she's okay.
No SOS needed; no rescuing, she's fine out there
No SOS needed; no rescuing, she's fine out there
Yeah, she's got life in her veins
She don't need no rescue and she's okay
She looks into the sky
And all her tears are dry
She kiss her fears goodbye
She's gonna be alright.
But things were bad
It was beyond repair.
She was scared
She couldn't handle it.
Things were bad but now she's glad
Can't you tell - she's walking on air?
Chorus:
Yeah, she's got a light in her face
She don't need no rescue and she's okay.
Yeah, she's got life in her veins.
She don't need no rescue and she's okay.
No SOS needed; no rescuing, she's fine out there
No SOS needed; no rescuing, she's fine out there
Yeah, she's got life in her veins.
She don't need no rescue and she's okay
That girl is you, yeah
And that girl is me
That girl is stronger than the raging sea
That girl is you, yeah
And that girl is me
That girl is stronger than the raging sea
Chorus:
Yeah, she's got a light in her face
She don't need no rescue and she's okay.
Yeah, she's got life in her veins.
She don't need no rescue and she's okay.
No SOS needed; no rescuing, she's fine out there
No SOS needed; no rescuing, she's fine out there
Yeah, she's got life in her veins
She don't need no rescue and she's okay
