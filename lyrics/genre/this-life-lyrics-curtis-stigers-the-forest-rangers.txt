blues
Ridin' through this world
All alone
God takes your soul
You're on your own
The crow flies straight
A perfect line
On the devil's path
Until you die
This life is short
Baby that's a fact
Better live it right
You ain't comin' back
Gotta raise some hell
Before they take you down
Gotta live this life
Gotta look this world
In the eye
Gotta live this life
Till you die
You better have soul
Nothin' less
Cause when it's business time
It's life or death
The king is dead
But life goes on
Don't lose your head
When a deal goes down
Better keep your eye
On the road ahead
Gotta live this life
Gotta look this world
In the eye
Gotta live this life
Till you die
