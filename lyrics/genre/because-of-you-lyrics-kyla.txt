Kyla
metal
If ever you wondered if you touched my soul, yes you do
Since I met you I'm not the same
You bring life to everything I do
Just the way you said hello
With one touch I can't let go
Never thought I'd fall in love with you
CHORUS
Because of you, my life has changed
Thank you for the love and joy you bring
Because of you, I feel no shame
I'll tell the world it's because of you
Sometimes I get lonely and all I gotta do is think of you
You captured somethin' inside of me
You make all my dreams come true
It's not enough that you love me for me
You reached inside and touched me internally
I love you best explains how I feel for you
CHORUS
Because of you, my life has changed
Thank you for the love and joy you bring
Because of you, I feel no shame
I'll tell the world it's because of you
My life has changed
Thank you for the love and joy you bring
Because of you, I feel no shame
I'll tell the world it's because of you
BRIDGE
The magic in your eyes
True love I can't deny
When you hold me I just lose control
I want you to know that I'm never letting go
You mean so much to me, I want the world to see
It's because of you
CHORUS
Because of you, my life has changed
Thank you for the love and joy you bring
Because of you, I feel no shame
I'll tell the world it's because of you
My life has changed
Thank you for the love and joy you bring
Because of you, I feel no shame
I'll tell the world it's because of you
