All I see is you
When I wake up
You, when I talk
You, when I lie down
You, when I walk
You, when I'm sleeping
You', when I'm trying to breath
(You just keep on hunting me)
I'll get over the way that you got over me
I know that I'll make it very [?]
Get my heart to erase somehow
And stop wondering where are you now
If I gave it all to someone else instead
Will you pack your bags and get out of my head?
Someday I won't even look around
I'll stop wondering where are you now
