alternative
On the floating, ship less oceans
I did all my best to smile
Till your singing eyes and fingers
Drew me loving into your eyes
And you sang, "Sail to me
Sail to me, let me enfold you"
Here I am, here I am
Waiting to hold you
Did I dream you dreamed about me?
Were you here when I was flotsam?
Now my foolish boat is leaning
Broken lovelorn on your rocks
For you sang, "Touch me not
Touch me not, come back tomorrow"
Ohh my heart, ohh my heart
Shies from the sorrow
Well, I'm as puzzled as a newborn child
I'm as riddled as the tide
Should I stand amid the breakers?
Or shall I lie with death my bride?
Hear me sing, "Swim to me
Swim to me, let me enfold you"
Here I am, here I am
Waiting to hold you
