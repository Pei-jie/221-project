Hey you
So you never really found your way
Stay true
Did you ever make it through today?
I know that when I think about a day without it
Everyday's the same
You wish that you could find someone
But I'm the only one to blame
Can't you see I beg and plead?
'Cause when your eyes light up the skies at night
I know you're gonna find your way back to me
No don't
Don't you ever let a piece of me down
'Cause time won't
Get back when I'm never around
When we live between so many walls
That I can barely breathe
You say that you just want someone
But I'm the only one you need
Can't you see I beg and plead?
'Cause when your eyes light up the skies at night
I know you're gonna find your way
If it's me that you don't need
Then when the lights go out tonight
I know you're never gonna find your way
Soon when I get you, I won't let you go
Ooh if I let you you can take away all that I thought was wrong
And if you hear me there's not much to say
There's gotta be a better way
Can't you see I beg and plead?
'Cause when your eyes light up the sky tonight
I know you're gonna find your way back to me
Can't you see I beg and plead?
'Cause when the lights go out tonight
I know you're never gonna find your way
If it's me that you don't need
That when the lights go out tonight
I know you're never gonna find your way
If you pace around the world [Incomprehensible]
And when your eyes light up the skies at night
I know you're gonna find your way back to me
