Daddy Yankee:]
DY, you baby
Come, arriba, let's go now!
[:]
Wo-ah tonight, tonight we could be more than friends
Wo-ah tonight, tonight we should be more than friends.
We're in the corner of the crowded room
I want you lips, your body, boy, how soon?
And if you like what we doin' why dont we give in for the night.
This might just be the night of you and I,
If there is no distancee, no hearts tonight,
And if you like what we doin' why dont we give in for the night.
Wo-ah tonight, tonight we could be more than friends
Wo-ah tonight, tonight we should be more than friends.
From the first time that I saw the look in your eyes,
I've been thinking about you for all of this time,
Wo-ah tonight, tonight we could be more than friends.
Aint looking for someone to call my own,
But with you boy we're in danger zone,
And if you like what we doin' why dont we give in for the night.
So here we are, I just dream of you
And all the thing that I'm about to do to you,
And if you like what we doin' why dont we give in for the night.
Wo-ah tonight, tonight we could be more than friends
Wo-ah tonight, tonight we should be more than friends
From the first time that I saw the look in your eyes,
I've been thinking about you for all of this time,
Wo-ah tonight, tonight we could be more than friends.
[Daddy Yankee:]
Baby! She rings my bell, and they rush the floor
You mighta' think that's cool zaw
Everybody in the club was hot 'til I showed my watch
And they cooled out
Caliente! frío! que eso que tu tiene mío
Caliente! frío! que eso que tu tiene...
It's forever, (forever)
You could be mine
It's whatever (whatever)
Whatever you like
It's forever, (forever)
You could be mine
And I'm needing you right now
Baby come and hold me down
Caliente! frío! que eso que tu tiene mío.
[:]
Wo-ah tonight, tonight we could be more than friends
Wo-ah tonight, tonight we could be more than friends.
From the first time that I saw the look in your eyes,
I've been thinking about you for all of this time,
Wo-ah tonight, tonight we could be more than friends,
Tonight we could be more than friends,
Tonight we could be more than friends.
