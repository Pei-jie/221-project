Well, I've been neglecting
The good things, oh, oh, woah
Well I've been desiring
The good things, oh
I'm biting the lighting
The good things, oh, oh, woah
I've minding what to see
The good things, oh, oh, woah
Just let me out of my misery
Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh
On a night like this
Get out of misery, oh, oh
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Turn the lights on my nights
This is life
And we only get one thing
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Come on dance
Take a chance on romance
We only get one shot at this, oh
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Turn the lights on my nights
This is life
And we only get one thing, oh
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Come on dance
Take a chance on romance
We only get one shot at this, oh
Clap your hands
I'm trying to fly in the good things
Oh, oh, woah
I'm finding this might be a good thing
Oh, oh, woah
Just let me out of my misery
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, on a night like this
Get out of misery, oh, oh, oh
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Turn the lights on my nights
This is life
And we only get one thing, oh
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Come on dance
Take a chance on romance
We only get one shot at this, oh
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Turn the lights on my nights
This is life
And we only get one thing, oh
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Come on dance
Take a chance on romance
We only get one shot at this, oh
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Turn the lights on my nights
This is life
And we only get one thing, oh
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Come on dance
Take a chance on romance
We only get one shot at this, oh
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Turn the lights on my nights
This is life
And we only get one chance, oh
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Come on dance
Take a chance on romance
We only get one shot at this, oh
Clap your hands
