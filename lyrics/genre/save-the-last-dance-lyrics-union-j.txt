pop
You watch me, whike I'm watching
But you act like, it ain't nothing
The way that you're moving
I feel right into your grooving
I'm just about to prove it
'Cause only you can get in, I know you can, for free
If they can take it, I know that's on your own, baby
But you'll be coming home with me
I know you catch a lot of hearts, baby
Got the lining up tonight
You got them all revolving round and round
You're like a thousands satellites
Now they're falling hard
Like a house of cards
They blow away like [?]
I know the way the light is over dancing
Gonna save the last dance, save the last dance, for me
[Instrumental]
