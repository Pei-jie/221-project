Baby baby
Are you listening?
Wondering where you've been all my life
I just started living
Uh baby
Are you listening?
CHORUS
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
When you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
Baby, can you hear me
When I'm crying out for you
I'm scared
Oh so scared
When you're near me
I feel like I'm standing with an army
armed with weapons
Hey, oh
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
When you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
I love lying next to you
I could do this for eternity
You and me
We're meant to be in holy matrimony
God knew exactly what he was doing
When he led me to you
When you say you love me
Know I love you more (I love you more)
When you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
When you say you love me
Know I love you more
When you say you need me
Know I need you more
Boy, I adore you
I adore you
