Nothing is provocative, anymore even for kids
No room for imagining
'Cause everyone's seen everything
Question what the T.V tells you
Question what a Pop Star sells you
Question Mum and Question Dad
Question Good and Question Bad
If History could set you free,
(From who you were supposed to be)
If sex in a society
(Didn't tell a girl who she would be)
'Cause all my life I've tried to fight what History has given me, me!
chorus:
Sex sex sex sex yeah
La da da (sex sex sex sex yeah)
La da da da dada da da (sex sex sex sex yeah)
La da da (sex sex sex sex yeah)
La da da da dada da da (sex sex sex sex)
If women were religiously, recognized sexually,
We wouldn't have to feel the need
To show our ass it's to feel free
Been there done that got the t-shirt
Sold my soul and Yeah the truth hurt
Tired image of a star
Acting naughtier than we really are
If History could set you free
(From who you were supposed to be)
If sex in a society
(Didn't tell a guy who he should be)
'Cause all my life I've tried to fight what History has given me, me!
Chorus:
Sex sex sex sex yeah
La da da (sex sex sex sex yeah)
La da da da dada da da (sex sex sex sex yeah)
La da da (sex sex sex sex yeah)
La da da da dada da da (sex sex sex sex)
All my life I felt it deep inside of me
All this time was fighting for what I believed
All my life I've tried to hide what History has given me, me.
If History could set you free
(From who you were supposed to be)
If sex in a society
(Didn't tell a guy who he should be)
'Cause all my life i've tried to fight what history has given me, me.
Chorus:
Sex sex sex sex yeah
La da da (sex sex sex sex yeah)
La da da da dada da da (sex sex sex sex yeah)
La da da (sex sex sex sex yeah)
La da da da dada da da (sex sex sex sex)
