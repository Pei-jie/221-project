Funny how
Everytime, that I'm down
You pick me up, you stand by me
People ask, what's the deal?
Why still so in love?
Maybe, it's meant to be
Feels like I'm falling into soon
Even when life is like, a fire
But feels like we've walked
As we watched the years go by
Feels like we're still flying high
Baby you amaze me
Still knock me off my feet
And who would have ever guessed it would last through it all
The reason I believe, can you see?
Still amaze me
Baby you amaze me
Still knock me off my feet
And who would have ever guessed it would last through it all
The reason I believe, can you see?
Still amaze me
