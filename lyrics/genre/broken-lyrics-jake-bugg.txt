I'll wait here for you for I'm broken
Down, coming down this town
For my heart lies
Far and away where they took you down
Led them over to your house
Where I'm broken
Down by the people if they let you breathe
Don't give a damn if you
Still can't see still my heart beats for you
Have become all I lost
And all I hoped for
But I must carry on
Always one never broken
Run to the lobby where I saw you try
Don't give a damn for your reasons why
Why I'm broken
Down in the valley where the church bells cry
I'll lead them over to your eyes
I am one
I am one
Break a story of slonge
Peace and love in a future
Bright sacrifice came around
Never broken
Down by the people if they let you breathe
Don't give a damn if you still can't see
Travlin' street that I did not know
Wheels like tong to the winter lope
Down in the valley where the church bells cry
I'll lead them over to your eyes
I am one
I am one
