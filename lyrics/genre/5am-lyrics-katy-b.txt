My feet won't stop I can't keep still
We rocking this until the sunlight
That beat so sick, that tune so ill
Seems they know just how to move me right
He looks my way, won't waste my time
Looking in all the wrong places
And that history repeat in parallel line
A sucker for those pretty faces
Oooh, I need somebody to calm me down
A little loving like Valium
I need somebody to knock me out
I need some loving like
Oooh, I don't know what I'm running from
But when the sun comes up
It won't be long
I need some loving like Valium
I need some loving like
It's 5 AM, all on my own
I just need someone to talk with me
I lost my friends, I check my phone
Still searching for someone to walk with me
My demons rise, they take their place
I wish I had a pure embrace
To keep me running till the sunrise
Oooh, I need somebody to calm me down
A little loving like Valium
I need somebody to knock me out
I need some loving like
Oooh, I don't know what I'm running from
But when the sun comes up
It won't be long
I need some loving like Valium
I need some loving like
I, I, I, I, I need some loving like
I, I, I, I, I need some loving like
I, I, I, I, I need some loving like
I, I, I, I, I need some loving like
Close my eyes, numb the pain
...
Leave me down, treat me kind
Take the stress is on my mind
...
Nothing in the way of us
Keep me here, keep me calm
Let my dreams in your arms
Oooh, I need somebody to calm me down
A little loving like Valium
I need somebody to knock me out
I need some loving like
Oooh, I don't know what I'm running from
But when the sun comes up
It won't be long
I need some loving like Valium
I need some loving like
