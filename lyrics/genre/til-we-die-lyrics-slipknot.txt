My friends are all hurting
From moments and regrets
And charity laced with a lie
And still we keep hoping
To fix all the defects
And strengthen these seminal ties
We go on together for better or worse
Our history is too real to hate
Now and forever, we stay until morning
And promise to fight for our fates
'Til we die
'Til we die
The start of the journey is every bit worth it
I cant let you down anymore
The sky is still clearing, we're never afraid
And the consequence opens the door
I never stopped trying, I've never stopped feeling
Like family is much more than blood
Don't go on without me
The piece that I represent compliments
Each and everyone
'Til we die
'Til we die
We won't be forgotten
We'll never give in
This war we've achieved
Has allowed us to win
'Til we die
'Til we die
My last true confession will open your eyes
I've never known trust like the 9
Let it be spoken, let it be screamed
They'll never, ever take us alive
'Til we die
'Til we die
We won't be forgotten
We'll never give in
This war we've achieved
Has allowed us to win
Carry on
Carry on
We'll never be broken, we won't be denied
Our war is the pressure, we need to unite
We'll never be broken, we won't be denied
Our war is the pressure, we need to unite
'Til we die
'Til we die
We won't be forgotten
We'll never give in
This war we've achieved
Has allowed us to win
Carry on
Carry on
We'll never be broken
We won't be denied
Our war is the pressure
We need to unite
'Til we die
'Til we die
'Til we die
'Til we die
We won't be forgotten
We'll never give in
This war we've achieved
Has allowed us to win
'Til we die
'Til we die
We'll never be broken
We won't be denied
Our war is the pressure
We need to unite
