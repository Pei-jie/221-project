Ooh she may be weary
And young girls they do get weary
Wearing that same old shaggy dress yeah
But when she gets weary
You gotta try a little tenderness yeah yeah
You know she's waiting
Just anticipating
The thing that she'll never, never, never, never possess yeah yeah
But while she's there waiting, and without them
Try just a little bit of tenderness
That's all you gotta do
It's not just sentimental, no no no
She has her grief and care
Yeah yeah yeah
But the soft words
They are spoke so gentle, yeah
It makes it easier
Easier to bare, yeah
You won't regret it, no no
Young girls they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness, yeah
But it's all so easy
All you got to do is try, try a little, tenderness yeah
All you've gotta do is, man
Hold her where you want her
Squeeze her, don't tease her
Never leave her, get to her
Just try, try a little tenderness, yeah yeah yeah
You got to know how to love her, man
Take this advice, man
You got to squeeze her
Don't tease her, never leave
You got to hold her
And brother, something else
Try a little tenderness, yeah yeah yeah yeah
You've got to tenderness, now, uh
I tell you, don't lose her, no no
You got to love her, tease her
Don't leave her
Got to try, now now now
Try, try a little tenderness, yeah
Watch the groove
You got to know what to do, man
Take this advice
You gotta love and squeeze
Don't tease my baby
Love her, lord
