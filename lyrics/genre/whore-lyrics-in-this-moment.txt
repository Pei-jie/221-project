I'm the girl you're thinking about
The one thing you can't live without
Yeah, I'm the girl you've been waiting for
I'll have you down on your knees
I'll have you begging for more
You probably thought I wouldn't get this far
You thought I'd end up in the back of a car
You probably thought that I'd never escape
I'd be a rat in a cage, I'd be enslaved in this place
You don't know how hard I fought to survive
Waking up all alone when I was left to die
And you don't know about this life I've lived
Or these roads I've walked
Or these tears I've bled
So how can this be?
You're praying to me
There's a look in your eyes
I know just what that means
I can be, I can be your everything...
I can be your whore
I am the dirt you created
I am the sinner
I am your whore
Let me tell you something baby
You love me for everything you hate me for
I'm the one that you need and fear
Now that you heard this I'll be coming clear
That higher judgement that you placed on me is a reflection of the stuff I write
So maybe next time when you cast your stones
From the shadows and the dark unknown
You will crawl out of your hiding place
Take a look in the mirror and see the truth on your face
So how can this be?
You're praying to me
There's a look in your eyes
I know just what that means
I can be, I can be your everything...
I can be your whore
I am the dirt you created
I am the sinner
I am your whore
Let me tell you something baby
You love me for everything you hate me for
The
That's a look on
I am the dirt you created
I am the sinner
I am your whore
Let me tell you something baby
You love me
You want me
You need me
So how can this be?
You're praying to me
There's a look in your eyes
I know just what that means
I can be, I can be your everything...
I can be your whore
I am the dirt you created
I am the sinner
I am your whore
Let me tell you something baby
You love me for everything you hate me for
