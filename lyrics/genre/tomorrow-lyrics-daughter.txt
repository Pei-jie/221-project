Daughter
indie
By tomorow we'll be swimming with the fishes
Leave out troubles on the side.
And when the sun comes up,
we'll be nothing but dust,
just the outlines of our hands.
By tomorrow we'll be lost amongst the leaves,
in a wind that chills the skelletons of trees,
and when the moon, it shines, I will leave two lines.
Just find my love, then find me.
But don't bring tomorrow,
'cause I already know...
... I'll lose you...
Don't bring tomorrow,
'cause I already know...
... I'll lose...
... I'll lose you...
By tomorrow I'll be left in the darkness,
amongst your cold sheets.
and your shoes will be gone,
and your body warmth no longer beside me.
But don't bring tomorrow,
'cause I already know...
... I'll lose you...
Don't bring tomorrow,
'cause I already know...
... I'll lose...
... I'll lose...
... You...
