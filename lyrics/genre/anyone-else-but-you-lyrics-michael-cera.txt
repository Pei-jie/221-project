You're a part-time lover and a full-time friend
The monkey on your back is the latest trend
Don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you
Here is the church and here is the steeple
We sure are cute for two ugly people
Don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you
We both have shiny happy fits of rage
I want more fans, you want more stage
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you
You're always trying to keep it real
And I'm in love with how you feel
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train
I kiss you all starry-eyed, my body's swinging from side to side
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me
So why can't you forgive me?
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you
Doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo, doo-doo doo-doo
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else but you
