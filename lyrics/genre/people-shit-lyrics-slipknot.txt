Here we go again, motherfuckers
Come on down, and see the idiot right here
Too fucked to beg and not afraid to care
What's the matter with calamity anyway?
Right, get the fuck outta my face
Understand that I can't feel anything
It isn't like, I wanna sift through the decay
I feel like a wound, like I got a fuckin'
Gun against my head, you live when I'm dead
One more time, motherfuckers
Everybody hates me now, so fuck it
Blood's on my face and my hands, and I
Don't know why, I'm not afraid to cry
But that's none of your business
Whose life is it? Get it, see it, feel it, eat it
Spin it around so I can spit in it's face
I wanna leave without a trace
'Cuz I don't wanna die in this place
People equal shit
People equal shit
People equal shit
People equal shit
(Whatcha gonna do?)
People equal shit
('Cuz I am not afraid of you)
People equal shit
(I'm everything you'll never be)
People equal shit
It never stops, you can't be everything to everyone
Contagion, I'm sittin' at the side of Satan
What do you want from me?
They never told me the failure I was meant to be yea
Overdo it, don't tell me you blew it
Stop your bitchin' and fight your way through it
I'm not like you, I just fuck up
Hear me motherfucker, everybody has to die
Hear me motherfucker, everybody has to die
People equal shit
People equal shit
People equal shit
People equal shit
(Whatcha gonna do?)
People equal shit
('Cuz I am not afraid of you)
People equal shit
(I'm everything you'll never be)
People equal shit
Ride the light
