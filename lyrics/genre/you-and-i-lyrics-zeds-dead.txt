light me up a cigarette
put it in my mouth
your the only one who wants me around
and i can think of a thousand reasons why
I don't believe in you
I don't believe in you and I(x2)
Go ahead and fill my drink up, you still be all I think of,
we try to stay afloat but know the weight'll sink us,
I say the problems solved - once you forget the question but you go ask again cause you aint
learned your lesson and for the heavens i promise you no regrets for my mind is left in the past
when that promise is never kept to be honest i felt it strain call it lost
on the way for certain in my intentions i thought that i never swayed
but between the cameras flash i guess that it had to happen
the negatives to the perfect picture i had to have them,
and my collection consists of all that I had to take.
we celebrate in the sacrifices we had to make we had to we had to wait and prepare for the lost
over sold on the win and unaware of the cost,
Cause I can write a song, but can't unright my wrongs.
I guess you live and learn,learn when the love is gone
light me up a cigarette
put it in my mouth
your the only one who wants me around
and I can think of a thousand reasons why
I don't believe in you
I don't believe in you and I
now here we are again back from our darkest end
we'll keep this happiness going as long as we all pretend
it seems we built this from nothing but broken dreams
these memories we'lll forget but thats all that we hope to see
I got my future in this ticket life is yours if you live it
you wish you could plan it different but fuck it thats how you miss it
I always hoped that you would visit
always thought it was you, always caught in the past cause its all that i fucking knew
its funny aint it,guess its all how you paint it
its that I really got but its all for the entertainment
the champagnes on the dresser
empty from all my efforts the life from yesterdays party is carried off in the stretcher
and here we stand like everythings how we planned it,
but who we kidding we drinking so we don't panic
drunk off that lucky 7, go ahead and tell the reverend,
we fucking rock stars, call us Zeds Deppelin
light me up a cigarette
put it in my mouth
your the only one who wants me around
and i can think of a thousand reasons why
I don't believe in you
I don't believe in you and I
