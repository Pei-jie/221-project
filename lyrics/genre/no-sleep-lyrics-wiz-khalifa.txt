Last night I let the party get the best of me
Wakin' up in the mornin', two ho's layin' next to me
Plus I heard a officer arrested me
Good weed and cold drinks, that's the muthafuckin' recipe
Nigga and we roll deep, so deep
It's goin' down in this bitch, concrete
We gon' party all night, no sleep
Tell the owner them is all my guys
So tonight everythin' is on me, the drinks is on me
The bitches, the hotel, the weed is all free
Get high, I mean so high, we don't see the whole suite
Then fly to a level where you gon' need your own key
TGOD
No drivin', no sleepin'
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long
No drivin', no sleepin'
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long
Leavin' from the club, now she wanna stay with us
Came to spend it all, don't care what I'm payin' for
Used to be too young, now I'm out here buyin' the bar
Every time I look up, it's another red cup
Bunch of niggas in the game but they ain't playin' with us
They just payin' enough
Man, them niggas ain't ballin', they just layin' it up
Sayin' they does
I'm just rollin' hella weed up
While on my way to the club
I had to wait at the club but now I don't
'Cause everythin' is on me
The drinks is on me
The bitches, the hotel, the weed is all free
Get high, I mean so high, we see the whole street
We fly, I mean so fly, we need a whole wing
TGOD
No drivin', no sleepin'
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long
No drivin', no sleepin'
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long
Party all day, party all night
Say you wanna party, let's party alright, ah
Party all day, party all night
Say you wanna party, let's party alright, ah
Party all day, party all night
Say you wanna party, let's party alright, ah
Party all day, party all night
Say you wanna party, let's party alright, ah
No drivin', no sleepin'
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long
No drivin', no sleepin'
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long
Party all day, party all night
Say you wanna party, let's party alright
Oooooh
