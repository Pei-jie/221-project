Another summer day
Has come and gone away
In Paris and Rome
But I wanna go home
Maybe surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel all alone, I wanna go home
Oh, I miss you, you know
And Ive been keeping all the letters
That I wrote to you, each one a line or two
Im fine baby, how are you?
I would send them but I know
That its just not enough, my words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that
Another airplane, another sunny place
Im lucky I know but I wanna go home
Ive got to go home, let me go home
Im just too far from where you are
I wanna come home
And I feel just like Im living someone elses life
Its like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not come along with me
This was not your dream
But you always believed in me
Another winter day
Has come and gone away
In even Paris and Rome
And I wanna go home
Let me go home
And Im surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel alone and I wanna go home
Oh, I miss you, you know
Let me go home
Ive had my run
Baby, Im done
I'm coming back home
Let me go home
It will all be all right
Ill be home tonight
Im coming back home
