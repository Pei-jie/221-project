how many times do i daydream about making love to you
i'll take you to a special place where it's only me and you
i'll put away all your troubles on the other side of the world
and wrap my arms around you, hon
and tell you you're my girl
(so let's go sail away in the night)
and we'll go far away from here
(tell you that's where our love is right)
can i take you to my world?
whenever you're sad
whenever you're crying
i'll be the one who wipes away your tears
whenever you're cold
whenever you need me
i'll be the one who runs to you
give you my love
well, you know how much i love you
so you better not let me down
i'm not asking for too much baby
just stick around
a quiet day in the country
or a rainy night in my room
we'll hide away in a time machine
if the morning comes too soon
an afternoon in your eyes
or a lifetime in your heart
forever just ain't long enough
but at least it's a good start
(falling deeper in love with you)
will you be there to catch me girl?
(i hope you're falling deep with me too)
can i keep you in my world?
whenever you're sad
whenever you're crying
i'll be the one who wipes away your tears
whenever you're cold
whenever you need me
i'll be the one who runs to you
give you my love
well you know how much i love you
so you better not let me down
i'm not asking for too much baby
just stick around
forever.. forever..
ooh would you come on baby
(let's go sail away in the night)
and we'll go far away from here
(tell you that's where our love is right)
ooh cause whenever you're sad
whenever you're crying
i'll be the one who wipes away your tears
whenever you're cold
whenever you need me
i'm gonna be right there for you and give you my love, yeah yeah
and you know how much i love you
so you better not let me down
i'm not asking for too much baby
just stick around
forever.. forever..
