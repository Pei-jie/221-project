rock
No matter how many times that you told me you wanted to leave
No matter how many breaths that you took you still couldn't breathe
No matter how many nights that you'd lie wide awake to the sound of the poison rain
Where did you go
Where did you go
Where did you go
Heart beat, a heart beat, I need a, heart beat, a heart beat
Tell me would you kill to save for a life
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right
Crash crash
Burn let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground
No matter how many deaths that I die I will never forget
No matter how many lives I live I will never regret
There is a fire inside of this heart and a riot about to explode into flames
Where is your God
Where is your God
Where is your God
Do you really want
Do you really want me
Do you really want me dead or alive
To torture for my sins
Do you really want
Do you really want me
Do you really want me dead or alive
To live a lie
Tell me would you kill to save a life
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right
Crash crash
Burn let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground
You say you wrong, you wrong, I'm right, I'm right, you're wrong, we fight
Ok, I'm running from the light, running from the day to night
Oh, the quiet silence defines our misery
The riot inside keeps trying to visit me
No matter how we try, it's too much history
Too many bad notes playing in our symphony
So let it breathe, let it fly, let it go
Let it fall, let it crash, burn slow
And then you call upon God
You call upon God
Tell me would you kill to save a life
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right
Crash crash
Burn let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground
This hurricane
This hurricane
This hurricane
Do you really want
Do you really want me
Do you really want me dead or alive
To torture for my sins
Do you really want
Do you really want me
Do you really want me dead or alive
To live a lie
