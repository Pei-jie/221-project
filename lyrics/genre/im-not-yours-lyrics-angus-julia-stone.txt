Light me up a cigarette and put it in my mouth
You're the only one that wants me around
And I can think of a thousand reasons why
I don't believe in you, I don't believe in you and I
Light me up a cigarette and put it in my mouth
You're the only one that wants me to die
And I can think of a thousand reasons why
I don't believe in you, I don't believe in you
I'm not yours anymore
I'm not yours anymore
No, I, I'm not yours anymore
I'm not yours anymore
Jump into your white mobile and runaway
You're always leaving me behind
And I can think of a thousand reasons why
I don't believe in you, I don't believe in you and I
I'm not yours anymore
I'm not yours anymore
No, I, I, I'm not yours anymore
No, I, I'm not yours anymore, anymore
Light me up a cigarette and put it in my mouth
You're the only one that wants me around
And I can think of a thousand reasons why
I don't believe in you, I don't believe in you and I
I'm not yours anymore
I'm not yours anymore
I'm not yours anymore
I'm not yours anymore
