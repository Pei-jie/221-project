Bullet%20For%20My%20Valentine
metal
Forever and always
The time is here again, prepare to be apart
And it drives you crazy
Each time I go away the distance gets longer
But it makes us stronger
Should it all come crashing down around me?
Would you be there?
Should I stumble or fall and pick up the pieces?
Oh, forget about the shit that we've been through
I wanna stay here forever and always
Oh, standing here in front of all of you
I wanna stay here forever and always
These days are dead again, it's empty from the start
And it drives me crazy
The hours drift away, it hurts to remember
This will soon be over
Should it all come crashing down around me?
Would you be there?
Should I stumble or fall and pick up the pieces?
Oh, forget about the shit that we've been through
I wanna stay here forever and always
Oh, standing here in front of all of you
I wanna stay here forever and always
Forever and always
Always, always, always
Forever and always
Oh, oh, oh, forever and always
Oh, oh, oh, forever and always
Always, always
