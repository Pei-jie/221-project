This town is coming like a ghost town
(Town)
All the clubs have been closed down
This place is coming like a ghost town

Bands won't play no more
Too much fighting on the dance floor
Do you remember the good old days before the ghost town?
We danced and sang as the music played in any boomtown
This town is coming like a ghost town

Why must the youth fight against themselves?
Government leaving the youth on the shelf
This place is coming like a ghost town

No job to be found in this country
Can't go on no more
The people getting angry
This town is coming like a ghost town
This town is coming like a ghost town
This town is coming like a ghost town
This town is coming like a ghost town
This town is coming like a ghost town
This town is coming like a ghost town
This town is coming like a ghost town
This town is coming like a ghost town
