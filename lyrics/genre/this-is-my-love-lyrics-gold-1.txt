Ill put you in front of me
I know that Ill be all right .
Spoken:
Now Hollywood wants to make you think they know what love is
But Im a tell you what love is love is not what you see in the movies
Is not just ecstasy, sex and passion
Love is sacrifice
Always banking my mind that hes waiting for you,
If youre crossing the line from this world is true
Now I realised and I know that youre gone, so gone, ooh
Signs from my God this feeling
Now what I found, this is deeper than life
I know that I get lost in this feeling, ooh
I can see all in me, all in me
Chorus:
Ill put you in front of me so everybody can see my love (my love), this is my love (this is my love)
I know that Ill be all right as long as you are my guide, my love, this is my love
Ill put you in front of me so everybody can see my love (my love), this is my love
(this is my love)
I know that Ill be all right as long as you are my guide my love, this is my love
My Love, Ill be all right
You know this is my love (this is my love), live on,
This is my love for Sean, this is my love (my love)
This is my love for joy, this is my love, live long, this
Never thought in my heart that Id be searching for you
A universe for two, a soul beats right through
And now Im away and you see that its fate, its fate
Ooh, signs from my God this feeling
Now what I found, this is deeper than life
I know that I get lost in this feeling
Ooh, I can see all in me, all in me
Ill put you in front of me so everybody can see, my love, this is my love
I know that Ill be all right as long as you are my guide, my love, this is my love
You know this is my love, this is my love live on
This is my love for joy, this is my love
This is my love, hold on, this is my love, live long, this is my love
Ill put you in front of me so everybody can see, my love, this is my love
I know that Ill be all right as long as you are my guide, my love, this is my love
Ill put you in front of me so everybody can see, my love, this is my love
I know that Ill be all right as long as you are my guide, my love, this is my love
