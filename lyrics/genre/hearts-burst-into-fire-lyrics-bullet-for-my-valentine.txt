Bullet%20For%20My%20Valentine
metal
I'm coming home
I've been gone for far too long
Do you remember me at all?
I'm leaving
Have I fucked things up again?
I'm dreaming
Too much time we'd have to spend
It hurts, wounds so sore
Now I'm torn, now I'm torn
I've been far away
When I see your face
My hearts burst into fire
Hearts burst into fire
You're not alone
I know I'm far from home
Do you remember me at all?
I'm leaving
Do you wait for me again?
I'm screaming
No more days we'd have to spend
It hurts, wounds so sore
Now I'm torn, now I'm torn
I've been far away
When I see your face
My hearts burst into fire
Hearts burst into fire
My beds become so lonely
No arms or sheets to hold me
Has this world stopped turning?
I'll wait forever to be apart, forever to be apart
It hurts, wounds so sore
Now I'm torn, now I'm torn
I've been far away
When I see your face
My hearts burst into fire
Hearts burst into fire
I'm coming home
I've been gone for far too long
Do you remember me at all?
Do you remember me at all?
I'm leaving
I'm screaming
I'm dreaming
My hearts burst into fire
