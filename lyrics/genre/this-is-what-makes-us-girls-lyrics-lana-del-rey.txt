pop
Remember how we used to party up all night?
Sneaking out and looking for a taste of real life.
Drinking in the small town firelight.
(Pabst blue ribbon on ice)
Sweet Sixteen and we had arrived
Walking down the streets as they whistle "hi, hi!"
Stealing police cars with the senior guys
Teachers said that we never make it out alive.
There she was, my new best friend
High heels in her hands
Swaying in the wind
Then she starts to cry
Mascara running down her little Bambi eyes
"Lana how I hate those guys"
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Something that we'd die for
It's our curse.
Don't cry about it
Don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together cause we put love first
Don't cry about him
Don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen.
And that's where the beginning of the end begun.
Everybody knew that we had too much fun
We were skipping school and drinking on the job
With the boss...
Sweet Sixteen and we had arrived.
Baby's table dancing at the local dive
Cheering our names in the pink spotlight
Drinking cherry Schnaps in the velvet night.
Yeah we used to go break in, to the hotel
Glimmer and we'd swim
Running from the cops in our black bikini tops
Screaming 'Get us while we're hot'
Come on, take a shot
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Something that we'd die for
It's our curse.
Don't cry about it
Don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together cause we put love first
Don't cry about him
Don't cry about him
Its all gonna happen
The prettiest in crowd that you had ever seen.
Ribbons in our hair and our eyes gleamed green.
A freshman generation of degenerate beauty queens
And you know something?
They were the only friends I ever had
We got into trouble and when stuff got bad
I got sent away,
I was waving on a train platform
Crying, cause I know I'm never coming back.
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Dont' you know we'd die for it
It's our curse.
Don't cry about it
Don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together cause we put love first
Don't cry about him
Don't cry about him
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Something that we'd die for
It's our curse.
Don't cry about it
Don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together cause we put love first
Don't cry about it
Don't cry about it
