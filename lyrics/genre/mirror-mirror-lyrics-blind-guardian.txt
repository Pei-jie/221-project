Far, far beyond the island
We dwelt in shades of twilight
Through dread and weary days
Through grief and endless pain
It lies unknown the land of mine
A hidden gate to save us from the shadow fall
The lord of water spoke
In the silence words of wisdom
"I've seen the end of all
Be aware, the storm gets closer"
Mirror, mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind, can't you see
That the winds will change?
Mirror mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind, can't you see
That tomorrow bears insanity?
Gone's the wisdom of a thousand years
A world in fire, in chains and fear
Leads me to a place so far, deep down it lies
My secret vision, I'll better keep it safe
Shall I leave my friends alone
Hidden in my twilight hall?
I know the world is lost in fire
Sure there is no way to turn it
Back to the old days
Of bliss and cheerful laughter
We're lost in barren lands
Caught in the running flames alone
How shall we leave the lost road?
Time's getting short so follow me
A leader's task so clearly
To find a path out of the dark
Mirror, mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind, can't you see
That the winds will change?
Mirror, mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind, can't you see
That the winds will change?
Even though the storm calmed down
The bitter end is just a matter of time
Shall we dare the dragon, Merciless
He's poisoning our hearts, our hearts
How shall we leave the lost road?
Time's getting short so follow me
A leader's task so clearly
To find a path out of the dark
Mirror, mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind, can't you see
That the winds will change?
Mirror, mirror on the wall
True hope lies beyond the coast
You're a damned kind, can't you see
That the winds will change?
