SAIL!
This is how I show my love.
I made it in my mind because
I blame it on my ADD baby.
This is how an angel cries
I blame it on my own sick pride
Blame it on my ADD baby
SAIL!
SAIL!
SAIL!
SAIL!
SAIL!
Maybe I should cry for help
Maybe I should kill myself (Chorus: myself)
Blame it on my ADD baby
Maybe I'm a different breed
Maybe I'm not listening
So blame it on my ADD baby
SAIL!
SAIL!
SAIL!
SAIL!
SAIL!
Lalalalala Lalalalalaoooo
Lalalalala Lalalalalaoooo
SAIL!
SAIL!
SAIL!
SAIL!
SAIL!
Sail with me into the dark...
Sail with me into the dark...
Sail with me into the dark...
Sail with me, sail with me...
Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh...
