If you're looking for love
Know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door without me
If you're trying to find pity
Well, you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else
I used to believe love conquers all
'Cause that's what I've seen in the movies
Come to find out it's not like that at all
You see, real life's much different
I don't wanna see you go
I only wanna see you smile
Hurt so much just thinking of
Felt like this for a while
I can't stand to see you fail
We tried, we lied and I pretend
To take us back to what we had
To make us feel alive again
Hold me close
Don't let me go
I hope, tell me now
It's not the end
If you're looking for love
Know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door without me
If you're trying to find pity
Well, you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else
I've turned into someone else
I used to believe love conquers all
'Cause that's what I felt when you held me
I thought you'd catch me if I'd fall
And fill me up when I'm empty
I don't wanna see you go
I only wanna see you smile
Hurt so much just thinking of
Felt like this for a while
I can't stand to see you fail
We tried, we lied and I pretend
To take us back to what we had
To make us feel alive again
Hold me close
Don't let me go
I hope, tell me now
It's not the end
If you're looking for love
Know that love don't live here anymore
He left with my heart
They both walked through that door without me
If you're trying to find pity
Well, you need to look somewhere else
'Cause I surely can't help you
I'm hurting myself
I've turned into someone else
