Paramore
rock
How can I decide whats are right?
When you're clouding up my mind
I cant win your losing fight
All the time
Nor could I ever owe what's mine
When you're always taking sides
But you won't take away my pride
No, not this time
Not this time
How did we get here
When I used to know you so well?
How did we get here?
Well, I think I know
The truth is hiding in your eyes
And its hanging on your tongue
Just boiling in my blood
But you think that I cant see
What kind of man that you are
If you're a man at all
Well, I will figure this one out
On my own
(I'm screaming, I love you so)
On my own
(But my thoughts you can't Decode)
How did we get here?
When I used to know you so well?
How did we get here?
Well, I think I know
Do you see what we've done?
Were gonna make such fools of ourselves
Do you see what we've done?
Were gonna make such fools of ourselves
How did we get here
When I used to know you so well? Yeah, Yeah
How did we get here
When I used to know you so well?
I think I know
I think I know
There is something I see in you
It might kill me, I want it to be true
