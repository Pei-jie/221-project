You shot me through the heart staring in your eyes
So I might die a happy man today
Just empty out your barrel
Girl, it's alright

You got weapons of mass seduction
If I was broke, I'd give you half of nothing
Or give it all, then I'd give you more
I'm no decorator but the writing's on the wall
Winter, Summer, Fall; April, May, and June
You shot me through the heart, but I don't have a wound
You got a good aim 'cause I could have sworn I moved
When it comes to relationships, I don't have a clue
Love at first sight, I dunno, I zoom
You put a hit out on me; bada bing bada boom
If this is pain, let me hurry up and suffer
What doesn't kill me should make my love tougher
I'm tough now, wassup now?
Fire at me, I swear I won't duck down
Wow, you had me in awe
You ain't have to shoot girl, you had me at your jaw.
You shot me through the heart staring in your eyes
So I might die a happy man today
Just empty out your barrel
Girl, it's alright

You take away my very breath
Call nine one one, Mary bless
No need to ask if I'm ready, yes
I'll go get my tux, and you go get your dress
And we gone do it big even though we just met
I was just bein' fresh
Yea, I know I'm a mess
But I like spontaneity, continuity,
Let it flow, let it flow, just you and me
Haha; And I'm not pressin' charges
Don't want you to ricochet and hit another target
You take me to the edge, right up to the margin
All I see is fireworks, I can feel it sparkin'
Hope you keep me at the center of your bulls-eye
And you know it's more beneficial full time
Haha; you are everything and more
You ain't have to shoot girl, you had me at your jaw
You shot me through the heart staring in your eyes
So I might die a happy man today
Just empty out your barrel
