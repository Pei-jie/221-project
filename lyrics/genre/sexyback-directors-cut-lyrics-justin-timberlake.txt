Justin Timberlake Sexy Back Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Im bringing sexy back
Them other boys donno know how to act
I think your special whats behind your back
So turn around and ill pick up the slack.
Take em to the bridge
[Bridge]
Dirty babe
You see these shackles
Baby Im your slave
Ill let you whip me if I misbehave
Its just that no one makes me feel this way
Take em' to the chorus
[Chorus]
Come here girl
Go ahead, be gone with it
Come to the back
Go ahead, be gone with it
VIP
Go ahead, be gone with it
Drinks on me
Go ahead, be gone with it
Let me see what youre twerkin with
Go ahead, be gone with it
Look at those hips
Go ahead, be gone with it
You make me smile
Go ahead, be gone with it
Go ahead child
Go ahead, be gone with it
And get your sexy on
Go ahead, be gone with it
Get yo' sexy on
[Repeat 6 times]
Get yo' sexy on
[Verse 2]
Im bringing sexy back
Them other fuckers dont know how to act
Come let me make up for the things you lack
Cause your burning up I gotta get it fast
Take em to the bridge
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Im bringing sexy back
You mother fuckers watch how I attack
If thats your girl you better watch your back
Cause shell burn it up for me and thats a fact
Take em to the chorus
[Chorus]
