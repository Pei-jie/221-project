Breach
metal
September falls Autumn's in the air
I have my dawn blazer, I'm plaiting my hair
Never on time that's the way it goes
Dragging my heels down atlantic road
For retching poor girl's clothes
They kept me safe when the world was cold
It didn't matter they have worn them before
I never wanted for anything more
When we were nothing we had it all
In your arms of love you kept me warm
It was all I wanted All I wanted
You gave me everything that you never
I think you're something that I wanna be
With your arms of love wrapped around me
I'm coming home I'm coming home
Cause you gave me everything that you never had
All I can do is try and give you something back
You gave me everything that you never had
You take my hand when I caught money
You kiss it better you heal me
And even now when it gets too much
You're by my side you pick me up
I'm retching second hand clothes
They keep me safe when the world is cold
It don't matter they have worn them before
And I don't want for anything more
When we were nothing we had it all
In your arms of love you kept me warm
It was all I wanted all I wanted
Cause you gave me everything that you never had
I think you're something that I wanna be
with your arms of love around me
I'm coming home I'm coming home
Cause you gave me everything that you never had
We laugh we cry we get by
And we gotta be strong
we always gotta stay strong
We struggle we fight and we ride
And we gotta be strong
We always gotta stay strong
When we were nothing we had it all
In your arms of love you kept me warm
It was all I wanted All I wanted
You gave me everything that you never had
I think you're something that I wanna be
With your arms of love wrapped around me
I'm coming home I'm coming home
Cause you gave me everything that you never had
All I can do is try and give you something back
You gave me everything that you never had
