metal
Led to the river
Midsummer I wave
A 'V' of black swans
On with hope to the grave
And through red September
When skies fire-paved
I begged you appear
Like a thorn for the holy ones
Cold was my soul
Untold was the pain
I faced, when you left me
A rose in the rain
So I swore to the razor
That never, enchained
Would your dark nails of faith
Be pushed through my veins again
Bared on your tomb
I am a prayer for your loneliness
And would you ever soon
Come above unto me?
For once upon a time
From the binds of your loneliness
I could always find
The right slot for your sacred key
Six feet deep is the incision
In my heart that barless prison
Discolors all with tunnel vision
Sunsetter, nymphetamine
Sick and weak from my condition
This lust, this vampiric addiction
To her alone in full submission
None better, nymphetamine
Nymphetamine, nymphetamine
Nymphetamine girl
Nymphetamine, nymphetamine
My nymphetamine girl
Wracked with your charm, I'm circled like prey
Back in the forest where whispers persuade
More sugar trails, more white lady laid
Than pillars of salt
Fall to my arms
Hold their mesmeric sway
And dance out to the moon
As we did in those golden days
Christening stars
I remember the way
We were needle and spoon
Mislaid in the burning hay
Bared on your tomb
I am a prayer for your loneliness
And would you ever swoon
Come above unto me?
For once upon a time
From the bind of your holiness
I could always find
The right slot for your sacred key
Six feet deep is the incision
In my heart that barless prison
Discolors all with tunnel vision
Sunsetter, nymphetamine
Sick and weak from my condition
This lust, this vampiric addiction
To her alone in full submission
None better, nymphetamine
Sunsetter, nymphetamine
None better, nymphetamine
Nymphetamine, nymphetamine
Nymphetamine girl
Nymphetamine, nymphetamine
My nymphetamine girl
