AFI
rock
I watched you glide out the door
With poise I'd not seen before
I saw you shineâ€¦ you shine
I collapsed to the floor
It promised it missed me more
And said, "True love is mine.
I missed you. Did you miss me?"
Slowly, it's consuming me
Deliberate and deep. I can't take this deeper panic
Teach me. Teach me not to dream
Dream deeply
I haven't left here for days
My panic keeps me awake
As he unwinds inside
He told me I should have known
That he'd hated the way I'd grown
To love soft lies, "She lied.
Do you miss her like I missed you?"
Slowly, it's consuming me
Deliberate and deep. I can't take this deeper panic
Teach me. Teach me not to dream
Dream deeply
Slowly, it's consuming me
Deliberate and deep. I can't take this deeper panic
Teach me. Teach me not to dream
Dream deeply
Slowly I swallowed your fears
For all of those years. How could you let them consume me?
Teach me. Teach me how you sleep
So sweetly.
Slowly, it's consuming me
Deliberate and deep. I can't take this deeper panic
Teach me. Teach me how you sleep
So Sweetly
