Love of my life, my soulmate
You're my best friend
Part of me like breathing
Now half of me is left
Don't know anything at all
Who am I to say you love me
I don't know anything at all
And who am I to say you need me
Color me blue I'm lost in you
Don't know why I'm still waiting
Many moons have come and gone
Don't know why I'm still searching
Don't know anything at all
And who am I to say you love me
I don't know anything at all
And who am I to say you need me
Hmmm hmmm mmm
Uhhh oohhh aahhh
Hooo aahhh ohh ohhh
Now you're a song I love to sing
Never thought it feels so free
Now I know what's meant to be
And that's okay with me
But who am I to say you love me
And who am I to say you need me
And who am I to say you love me
Mmmm hmmm
I don't know anything at all
And who am I to say you love me
I don't know anything at all
And who am I to say you need me
I don't know anything at all
I don't know anything at all
I don't know anything at all
I don't know anything at all
