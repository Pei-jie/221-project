Rule number one
Is that you gotta have fun
But baby when you're done
You gotta be the first to run
Rule number two
Just don't get attached to
Somebody you could lose
So let let me tell you
This is how to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like a little danger
We'll get them falling for a stranger, a player
Singing i la-la-la-love you
How to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like the look of danger
We'll get them falling for a stranger, a player
Singing I la-la-la-love you
At least i think i do
Cause i la-la-la-love you
Rule number three
Wear your heart on your cheek
But never on your sleeve
Unless you want to taste defeat
Rule number four
Gotta be looking pure
Kiss him goodbye at the door
And leave him wanting more, more
This is how to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like a little danger
We'll get them falling for a stranger, a player
Singing I la-la-la-love you
How to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like the look of danger
We'll get them falling for a stranger, a player
Singing I la-la-la-love you
At least i think i do
Cause I la-la-la-love you
Girls we do whatever it will take
Cause girls don't want
We don't want our hearts to break in two
So its better to be fake cant risk losing in love again babe
This is how to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like a little danger
We'll get them falling for a stranger a player
Singing I la-la-la-love you
How to be a heartbreaker
Boys they like the look of danger
We'll get them falling for a stranger a player
Singing I la-la-la-love you
Cause I la-la-la-love you
At least I think I do
