You're hard to hug, tough to talk to-
and I never fall asleep, when you're in my bed
all you give me is a heartbeat
I've turned into a statue
and it makes me feel depressed
'cause the only time you open up is when we get undressed.
You don't love me, big fucking deal
I'll never tell you how I feel
You don't love me, not a big deal,
I'll never tell you how I feel.
It almost feels like a joke to play out the part,
when you are not the starring role in someone else's heart.
You know I'd rather walk alone, than play a supporting role
if I can't get the starring role.
Sometimes I ignore you, so I feel in control
'cause really, I adore you and I can't leave you alone.
Fed up with the fantasies, they cover what is wrong.
Come on, baby, let's just get drunk, forget we don't get on
You like my dad, you get on well,
I send my best regards from hell.
It almost feels like a joke to play out the part,
when you are not the starring role in someone else's heart.
You know I'd rather walk alone, than play a supporting role
if I can't get the starring role.
I never sang for love, I never had a heart to mend.
Because before the start began, I always saw the end
Yeah, I wait for you to open up, to give yourself to me.
But nothing's ever gonna give, I'll never set you free.
Yeah I'll never set you free
It almost feels like a joke to play out the part,
when you are not the starring role in someone else's heart.
You know I'd rather walk alone, than play a supporting role
if I can't get the starring role....
The starring role.
