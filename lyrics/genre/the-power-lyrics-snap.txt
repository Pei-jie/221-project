Snap

[Foreign content]
I've got the power, hey, yeah, hey
Like the crack of the whip, I snap attack
Front to back in this thing called rap
Dig it like a shovel, rhyme Devil on a Heavenly level
Bang the bass, turn up the treble
Radical mind day and night all the time
Seven, fourteen, wise, divine
Maniac, brainiac, winning the game
I'm the lyrical Jesse James
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, gettin' kinda heavy
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda heavy
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda heavy
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda heavy
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda heavy
(I've got the power)
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts
(I've got the power, oh, oh, oh)
(I've got the power)
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts
(I've got the power, oh, oh, oh)
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda hectic
Quality, I possess some say I'm fresh
When my voice goes through the mesh
Of the microphone that I am holdin'
Copy written lyrics so they can't be stolen
If they are snap
Don't need the police to try to save them
Your voice will sieze, so please, stay off my back
Or I will attack and you don't want that
(I've got the power)
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts
(I've got the power, oh, oh, oh)
(I've got the power)
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts
(I've got the power, oh, oh, oh)
Quality, I possess something, I'm fresh
When my voice goes through the rest
Of the microphone that I am holdin'
Copy written lyrics so they can't be stolen
If they are snap
Don't need the police to try to save them
Your voice will sink, so please, stay off my back
Or I will attack and you don't want that
(I've got the power)
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts
He's gonna break my heart
He's gonna break my heart of hearts
(I've got the power, oh, oh, oh)
I've got the power, I've got the power
I've got the power, I've got the power
I've got the power, I've got the power
(Power)
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda hectic
It's getting', it's getting', it's gettin' kinda hectic
(Power)
I've got the power, I've got the power
I've got the power, I've got the power
Power
I've got the power, power
I've got the power, power, I've got, I've got
I've got the power, I've got the power
