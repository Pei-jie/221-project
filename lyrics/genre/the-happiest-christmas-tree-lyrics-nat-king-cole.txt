blues
With a hey and a hee and a hoo hoo
With a hee and a hoo and a hah hah
With a hoo and a hah and a hee hee
I'm the happiest Christmas tree
Hoo hoo hoo, hee hee hee
Someone came and they found me
And took me home with them
Oh, I'm the happiest Christmas tree
Hoo hoo hoo, hee hee hee
Look how pretty they dressed me
Oh, lucky, lucky me
I got shiny bells that jingle
And tiny lights that tingle
Whenever anyone passes by
I blink my lights and I wink my eye
Oh, I'm the happiest Christmas tree
Christmas day, wait and see
I'll be laughing happily
With a hoo-hoo-hoo-hee-hee
With a hey and a hee and a hoo hoo
With a hee and a hoo and a hah hay
With a hoo and a hah and a hey hey
Oh, I'm the happiest Christmas tree
Hoo hoo hoo, hee hee hee
Someone came and they found me
And took me home with them
Oh, I'm the happiest Christmas tree
Hoo hoo hoo, hee hee hee
Look how pretty they dressed me
Oh, lucky, lucky me
I got shiny bells that jingle
And tiny lights that tingle
Whenever anyone passes by
I blink my lights and I wink my eye
Oh, I'm the happiest Christmas tree
Christmas day, wait and see
I'll be laughing happily
With a hoo-hoo-hoo-hee-hee
With a hey and a hee and a hoo hoo
With a hee and a hoo and a hah hah
With a hey and a hee and a hoo hoo
With a hee and a hoo and a hah hah
With a hey and a hee and a hoo hoo
With a hee and a hoo
With a hee and a hoo
With a hee and a hoo
