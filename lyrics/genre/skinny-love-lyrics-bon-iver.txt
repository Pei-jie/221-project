C'mon skinny love just last the year
Pour a little salt we were never here
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right in this moment this order's tall
And I told you to be patient
And i told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
In the morning I'll be with you
but it will be a different "kind"
I'll be holding all the tickets
and you'll be owning all the fines
C'mon skinny love what happened here
Suckle on the hope in lite brazziers
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full; so slow on the split
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
Now all your love is wasted?
Then who the hell was I?
Now i'm breaking at the britches
and at the end of all your lines
Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?
