Yo, pretty ladies around the world
Got a weird thing to show you, so tell all the boys and girls
Tell your brother, your sister and your mamma too
'Cause they're about to throw down and you'll know just what to do
Wave your hands in the air like you don't care
Glide by the people as they start to look and stare
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance quick mamma
Come on baby, tell me what's the word
Word up, everybody say
When you hear the call, you've got to get it underway
Word up, it's the code word
No matter where you say it, you'll know that you'll be heard now
All you sucker DJ's who think you're fly
There's got to be a reason and we know the reason why
You try to put on those airs and act real cool
But ya got to realize that you're acting like fools
If there's music, we can use it, we need to dance
We don't have the time for psychological romance
No romance, no romance, no romance for me, mamma
Come on baby, tell me what's the word
Word up, everybody say
When you hear the call, you've got to get it underway
Low
Dial 'L' for Low
Low

Do your dance, do your dance

Do your dance, do do do do your dance, do your dance
Check it, baby
Do do do, do your dance, do your dance
Say like that
Say like that
[Incomprehensible]
Every body is gonna [Incomprehensible]
C'mon, all you people say
