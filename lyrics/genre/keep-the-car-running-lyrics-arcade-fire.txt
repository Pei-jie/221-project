Every night my dreams the same
Same old city with a different name
Men are coming to take me away
I dont know why but I know I cant stay
Theres a weight thats pressing down
Late at night you can hear the sound
Even the noise you make when you sleep
Cant swim across a river so deep
They know my name 'cause I told it to them
But they dont know where
They dont know when its coming, when its coming
Theres this fear I keep so deep
Knew its name since before I could speak, yeah, oh
They know my name 'cause I told it to them
But they dont know where
They dont know when its coming
Oh when its coming, keep the car running
If some night I dont come home
Please dont think Ive left you alone
The same place animals go when they die
You cant climb across a mountain so high
The same city where I go when I sleep
You cant swim across a river so deep
They know my name 'cause I told it to them
But they dont know where
They dont know when its coming
Oh when is it coming? Keep the car running
Keep the car running, keep the car running
