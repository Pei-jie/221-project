rock
[Chester]
It starts with one
[Mike]
One thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
[Chester]
All I know
[Mike]
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down 'till the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
[Chester]
It's so unreal
[Mike]
You didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, to didn't even know
I wasted it all just to
[Chester]
Watch you go
[Mike]
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when
[Chester]
I've tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
[Mike]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
[Chester]
I tried so hard
[Mike]
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised, it
[Chester]
Got so far
[Mike]
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you wouldn't knew me, back then
But it all comes back to me
[Chester]
In the end
[Mike]
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory
Of a time when
[Chester]
I've tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should've know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should've know
[Chester]
I've tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
