Kylie:
Im all by myself
I dont need anybody else
Im all by myself
No help
Im all on my own
Quietly sleeping in my home
Im all on my own
my own
Chris:
Hello
Wont you let me come in?
Lhuna, cant you hear how much Im suffering?
Hello
Wont you let me know?
Cos Im all alone
all alone
Both:
We are dreaming about Lhuna
The smell of her
The touch and the taste of her
dreaming about Lhuna
Her and me, simultaneously
Kylie:
I dont know what the time is
I dont know where youve flown
And I dont know why youre so far
from home
Chris:
Hello
Wont you let me come in?
Lhuna, cant you hear how much Im suffering?
Hello
Wont you let me know?
Cos Im all alone
all alone
Both:
We are dreaming about Lhuna
The smell of her
The touch and the taste of her
dreaming about Lhuna
Her and me, simultaneously
Her and me, effortlessly
oh her and me effortlessly
