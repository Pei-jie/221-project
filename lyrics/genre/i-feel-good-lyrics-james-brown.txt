blues
I feel good
I knew that I would now
I feel good, I knew that I would now
So good, so good
I got you
I feel nice, like sugar and spice
I feel nice, like sugar and spice
So nice, so nice
cause I got you
(music break)
When I hold you in my arms
I know that I can do no wrong
When I hold you in my arms
I know love can't do me no harm
I feel good, I knew that I would
I feel good, I knew that I would
So good, so good
I got you
(music break)
When I hold you in my arms
I know you won't do me no wrong
When I hold you in my arms
I know love won't do me no harm
I feel nice, like sugar and spice
I feel nice, like sugar and spice
So nice, so nice
I got you
So nice, so nice
I got you
So nice, so nice
I got you
