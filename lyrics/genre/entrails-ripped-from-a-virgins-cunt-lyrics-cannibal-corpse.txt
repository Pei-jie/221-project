Alive alone now that they've gone dead but unburied
I've seen it unfold, terrible scenes of agony
Eyes in the darkness, echoing their madness
The sights that have passed before them
Watching as though it has never happened
Now I only listen to what is not spoken
Murder, hatred, anger, savage
Killings I have caused more than can be counted
Orgies of sadism and sexual perversion
Virgin tied to my mattress, legs spread wide
Ruptured bowel, yanked from her insides
Devirginized with my knife, internally bleeding
Vagina, secreting her blood-wet pussy
I am eating on her guts, I am feeding
Mutilated with a machete
I fucked her dead body, the first and last
Your life's only romance
My knife's jammed in your ass
As you die you orgasm
Pass on to the dead
Nerve trembling convulsions
No longer looking human
I never see them but I know they're there
Locked in my subconscious
Obscene memories I thought I'd forgotten
Haunting unrealities tear at me
Hold her arms, her mouth taped shut
Screams unheard outpour her guts
Layers of flesh peeling away
Languish in your own decay
Descriptions of my killings, bone chilling
Terror, tear, her, virgin cunt
Virgins are my victims
Their tight interiors I explore
Sharpened utensils of torture
Now inserted inside of her
Sex organs extracted for eating
On her liver, I am gnawing
Forbidden lust for guts
Ripped from her cunt
Tears of blood cry down her thigh
I ram my fist inside her hole
From her crotch piss now flows
Rectum filled with shit
I fucked her emptied body
Until she became stiff
