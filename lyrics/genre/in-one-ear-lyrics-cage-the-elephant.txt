alternative
They say that we ain't got the style, we ain't got the class
We ain't got the tunes that's goin' to put us on the map
And I'm a phony in disguise, tryin' to make the radio
I'm an anti-social anarchist who sounds like so and so
They say I'm just a stupid kid, just a crazy radical
Rock and roll is dead, I probably should've stayed in school
Another generation X who somehow slipped up through the crack
Oh, they'd love to see me fall but I'm already on my back
So it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talkin' shit but you know I never bother
It goes to one ear and right out the other
People talkin' shit, they can kiss the back of my hand
Now I know I'm not a saint, I been a sinner all my life
I ain't tryin' to hide my flaws, I'd rather keep them in the light
They wanna criticize, scrutinize, cast another stone
Burn me at the stake and sit and watch it from the throne
They say the devil is my pal, I do a lotta drugs
The crowd will only like me if they're really fuckin' drunk
They think they know my thoughts, but they don't know the least
If they listened to the words they'd find the message that's beneath
But it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talkin' shit even though they never bother
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talkin' shit, they can kiss the back of my hand
You hear that? You hear what's comin'?
Oh, you better run for the hills 'cause we're comin' to your town
And we're gonna burn that motherfucker down
Here's the moral to the story, we don't do it for the glory
We don't do it for the money, we don't do it for the things
So all the critics who despise us go ahead and criticize us
It's your charity that drives us, adds the fire to our flames
And it goes in one ear and right out the other
People talkin' shit but you know I never bother
It goes in one ear, and right out the other
I'm only playin' music 'cause you know I fuckin' love it
It goes in one ear and right out the other
People talkin' shit but you know I never bother
It goes in one ear, and right out the other
People talkin' shit, they can kiss the back of my hand
