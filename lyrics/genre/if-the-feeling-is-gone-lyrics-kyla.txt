if the feeling is gone
please don't pretend
that you still love me
i can see it in your eyes
and it hurts to admit
i can tell that the feeling is gone
all I ask is just a little honesty
though I know that you're not
coming back to me
you know I'll do anything to
make you stay
but I just have to let you go
if the feeling is gone
there's a sadness in your smile
though I try to conceal it
I can tell if the feeling is gone
all I ask is just a little honesty
though I know that you're not
coming back to me
you know I'll do anything to
make you stay
but I just have to let you go
if the feeling is gone
all I ask is just a little honesty
though I know that you're not
coming back to me
you know I'll do anything to
make you stay
but I just have to let you go
I just have to let you go
I just have to let you go
if the feeling is gone
stay..
