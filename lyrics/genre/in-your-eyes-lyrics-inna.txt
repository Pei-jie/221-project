i want your body
won't live without it
so turn up the party
i'm feeling naughty
stay close to me
i'll be all that you need
don't deny
what you want baby
i want your body
all i desire
you relight the fire
just come with me
come with me
just gonna let it go tonight
all i want is you
thousand shades of blue
dancing in your eyes
i'm just gonna let it go tonight
i'm just wanna be
hold you close to me
dancing in your eyes
i want your body
i want your body
i want your body
it's getting hotter
the beat is louder
i know you want me
and i want your body
stay close to me
i'll be all that you need
don't deny
what you want baby
i want you body
all i desire
the relight the fire
just come with me
come with me
just gonna let it go tonight
all i want is you
thousand shades of blue
dancing in your eyes
i'm just gonna let it go tonight
i'm just wanna be
hold you close to me
dancing in your eyes
i want your body
i want your body
i want your body
i want your body
i want your body
