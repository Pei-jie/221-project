metal
Heaven's waiting for you
Just close your eyes and say goodbye
Hearing your pulse go on and on and on
I live my life in misery
I'd sacrifice this world to hold you
No breathe left inside of me
Shattered glass keeps falling
Say, say goodnight
Just sleep tight
Say goodnight
Flowers laid out for you
So many colors leave me blind
Seeing your face reflect from our baby's eyes
I live my life in misery
I'd sacrifice this world to hold you
No breathe left inside of me
Shattered glass keeps falling
Say, say goodnight
Just sleep tight
Say goodnight
So here I am
You're inside of me
So here I am
Our world is over
So here I am
You're inside of me
So here I am
Our world is over
Here I am with you
I'm there till the end
Memories are calling
So farewell, my friend
Farewell, my friend
Here I am with you
I'm there till the end
Memories are calling
So farewell, my friend
Farewell, my friend
