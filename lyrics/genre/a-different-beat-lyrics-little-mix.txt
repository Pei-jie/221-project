I got a spoonful of sugar
That I think you'd like
No, I don't wanna preach
But I think you might
Wanna come
(sip it up, sip it up)
(sip it up, sip it up, sip it up)
[Jade]
I might be young
But I know my mind
I'm sick of being told
What's wrong or right
So give it up
(give it up, give it up)
(give it up, give it up, give it up)
[Jesy]
Uh-oh, now there you go
Out of your comfort zone
Cause I'm breaking down
I'm breaking down, down, down, down
Ain't got nothing to prove
Walk a mile in my shoes
I know the one thing that counts
[ALL]
I got the right
To make up my mind
Say it loud and clear
For the whole wide world to hear
We're marching so loud
So turn up the drum
Say it loud and clear
For the whole wide world to hear.
Yeah, we must have different shoes on
We're marching to a different beat
Yeah!
So baby put your boots on
Keep marching to a different beat
Yeah.
[Leigh-Anne]
Never in the slow lane
Cause I like it fast
No time to waste
So we keep our feet on the gas
(I live it up, live it up)
(live it up, live it up, live it up)
[Jesy]
I might be young
I know who I am
So I don't follow like a marching band
So give it up
(give it up, give it up)
(give it up, give it up, give it up)
[Perrie]
Uh-oh, now there you go
Out of your comfort zone
Cause I'm breaking out

[Leigh-Anne]
I got my head up
Shoulders back
I'm doing me
So they can see
I'm marching to a different beat
I took a look in the mirror
And I like what I see
So baby, I keep keep marching
To a different beat
[ALL]
I got the right
To make up my mind
Say it loud and clear
For the whole wide world to hear
We're marching so loud
So turn up the drum
Say it loud and clear
For the whole wide world to hear.
