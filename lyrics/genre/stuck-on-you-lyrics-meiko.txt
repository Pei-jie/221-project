I must confess
When I wear this dress
I feel like dancing
The whole night with you
And when i do
do do do do do
I feel so happy
I'm stuck on you
Cuz you are the one
I could see havin' fun with
Not just for tonight
But for the rest of my life
You are the one i could never be done with
I want you tonight and for the rest of my life
do do do do do do
do do do do do do
do do do do do do
You are so dreamy
Feel like im in the movies
I feel so happy I'm stuck on you
Cuz you are the one
I could see havin' fun with
Not just for tonight
But for the rest of my life
You are the one i could never be done with
I want you tonight and for the rest of my life
do do do do do do
do do do do do do
do do do do do do
I'm stuck on you.
you
Cuz you are the one
I could see havin' fun with
Not just for tonight
But for the rest of my life
Cuz you are the one
I could see havin' fun with
Not just for tonight
But for the rest of my life
You are the one i could never be done with
I want you tonight and for the rest of my life
do do do do do
