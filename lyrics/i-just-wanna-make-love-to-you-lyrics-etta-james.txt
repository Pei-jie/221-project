blues
I don't want you to be no slave
I don't want you to work all day
But I want you to be true
And I just wanna make love to you
Love to you, ooh, ooh
Love to you
All I want to do is wash your clothes
I don't want to keep you indoors
There is nothing for you to do
But keep me making love to you
Love to you, ooh, ooh
Love to you
And I can tell by the way you walk that walk
I can hear by the way you talk that talk
And I can know by the way you treat your girl
That I can give you all the lovin' in the whole wide world
All I wanna do is make your bread
Just to make sure you're well fed
I don't want you sad and blue
And I just wanna make love to you
Love to you, ooh, ooh
Love to you, ooh
And I can tell by the way you walk that walk
And I can hear by the way you talk that talk
And I can know by the way you treat your girl
That I can give you all the lovin' in whole wide world
Oh, all I wanna do, all I wanna do is cook your bread
Just to make sure you're well fed
I don't want you sad and blue
And I just wanna make love to you
Love to you, ooh yeah
Love to you, ooh, ooh
Love to you
