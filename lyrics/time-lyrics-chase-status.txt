If you can find the time
To give your love to me
I will wait for you
If that's all you need
If you can find the time
If ever you're free
Just drop me a line
And tell me where you'll be
I'll be right here
If you can find the time
Just be sincere
If you can find the time
I'll wait for you
But if you can't find the time
Then cut me loose
Cause I don't have the time
And I don't have the patience
What do you take me for?
Why am I still waiting?
Cause while you decide.
I'm fucking suffocating.
Cause if you can't find the time
My bleeding heart won't make it x2
If you can find the time
To give your love to me
Just drop me a line
And tell me where you'll be
I'll be right here
If you can find the time
Just be sincere
Cause I don't have the time
And I don't have the patience
What do you take me for?
Why am I still waiting?
Cause while you decide.
I'm fucking suffocating.
Cause if you can't find the time
My bleeding heart won't make it x3
I'll be right here
If you can find the time
Just be sincere
If you can find the time
I'll wait for you
But if you can't find the time
Then cut me loose
Cause I don't have the time
And I don't have the patience
What do you take me for?
Why am I still waiting?
Cause while you decide.
I'm fucking suffocating.
Cause if you can't find the time
My bleeding heart won't make it x3
Cause I don't have the time x2
My bleeding heart won't make it
