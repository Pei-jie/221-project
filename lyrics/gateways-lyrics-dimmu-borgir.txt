The core principle of freedom
Is the only notion to obey
The formula of evolution of sin
Leading the way
The rebirth is the year of completion
As we slowly awaken from slumber
As we slowly awaken from slumber
The malpractice of the spirit ends
Gateways
When the gift is once again attained
Gateways
No rules are restraints are longer valid
Gateways
When the ancient future is reclaimed
Gateways
No rules are restraints are longer valid
Gateways
When the ancient future is reclaimed
Gateways
It's all there for the eyes that can see
The blind ones will always suffer in secrecy
For it is the omen of what lies submerged, breeding
Untouched within us, bleeding
The core principle of freedom
Is the only notion to obey
The formula of evolution of sin
Leading the way
The rebirth is near completion
As we slowly awaken from slumber
To receive the light that shines in darkness
The light that shines forever more
Forever more
Be the broken or the breaker
Be the giver or the undertaker
Unlock and open the door
Be the healer or the faker
The keys are in your hands
Realize you are your own sole creator
Of your own master plan
