Don't be so quick to walk away, dance with me
I wanna rock your body, please stay, dance with me
You don't have to admit you wanna play, dance with me
Just let me rock you 'til the break of day, dance with me
Got time, but I don't mind
Just wanna rock you girl
I'll have whatever you have
Come on let's give it a whirl
See I've been watchin' you
And I like the way you move
So go ahead, girl just do
That ass shakin' thing you do
So you grab your girls and you grab a couple more
And you all can meet me in the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smelling right
So you pass to the left, then you sail to the right
Don't be so quick to walk away, dance with me
I wanna rock your body, please stay, dance with me
You don't have to admit you wanna play, dance with me
Just let me rock you 'til the break of day, dance with me
I don't mean no harm
Just wanna rock you girl
You can move but be calm
Let's go, let's give it up girl
See it appears to me
You like the way I move
I tell you what I'm gon' do
Pull you close and share my groove
So you grab your girls and you grab a couple more
And you all can meet me in the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smelling right
So you pass to the left and you sail to the right
Don't be so quick to walk away, dance with me
I wanna rock your body, please stay, dance with me
You don't have to admit you wanna play, dance with me
Just let me rock you 'til the break of day, dance with me
Talk to me boy, no disrespect, I don't mean no harm
Talk to me boy, but I can't wait to have you in my arms
Talk to me boy, hurry up 'cause you're takin' too long
Talk to me boy, bet I'll have you naked by the end of this song
So what did you come here for?
I came to dance with you
And now you don't wanna hit the door
Need to romance with you
You been searchin' for love forever more
And I'll take a chance if love is here on the floor, girl
Yeah, dance with me
Yeah, come on baby
Don't be so quick to walk away, dance with me
I wanna rock your body, please stay, dance with me
You don't have to admit you wanna play, dance with me
Just let me rock you 'til the break of day, dance with me
Talk to me boy, no disrespect, I don't mean no harm
Talk to me boy, but I can't wait to have you in my arms
Talk to me boy, hurry up 'cause you takin' too long
Talk to me boy, bet I'll have you naked by the end of this song
Don't be so quick to walk away
Don't be so quick to walk away
Don't be so quick to walk away
Don't be so quick to walk away
You feelin' me
Let's do somethin'
