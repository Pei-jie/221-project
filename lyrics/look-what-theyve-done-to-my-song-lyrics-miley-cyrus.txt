Look what they've done to my song, Ma
Look what they've done to my song
Well, its the only thing I could do half right
It's turning out all wrong, Ma
Look what they've done to my song
Look what they've done to my brain, Ma
Look what they've done to my brain
Yeah, they picked it like a chicken bone
And they think i'm half insane, Ma
Look what they've done to my brain
Wish i could find a book to live in
Wish i could find a good book
Cause, if i could find a real good book
I'd never have to come out and look at
Look what they've done to my song
Na na na na na na na na... na na na na na na na
Well, if the people are buying tears
Then we'll be rich someday, Ma
Look what they've done to my brain
But maybe I'll be alright, Ma
Yeah, maybe I'll be OK
Cause, if the people are buying tears
Then we'll be rich someday, Ma
Look what they've done to my song
Look what they've done to my soul, Ma
Look what they've done to my soul
Yeah, they tied it in a plastic bag
And they shook me upside down, Ma
Look what they've done to my song
Look what they've done to my soul...
