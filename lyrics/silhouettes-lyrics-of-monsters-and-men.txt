rock
It's hard letting go,
I'm finally at peace, but it feels wrong,
Slow I'm getting up,
My hands and feet are weaker than before.
And you are folded on the bed
Where I rest my head,
There's nothing I can see,
Darkness becomes me.
But I'm already there,
I'm already there,
Wherever there is you,
I will be there too,
There's nothing that I'd take back,
But it's hard to say there's nothing I regret.
Cause when I sing, you shout,
I breath out loud,
You bleed, we crawl like animals,
But when it's over, I'm still awake.
A thousand silhouettes dancing on my chest,
No matter where I sleep, you are haunting me,
But I'm already there,
I'm already there.
Wherever there is you,
I will be there too,
But I'm already there,
I'm already there.
Wherever there is you
I will be there too.
Cause I'm already there,
I'm already there,
Wherever there is you,
I will be there too.
