We were lost in the middle
Like bottles in the ocean
But we found one another
Like the answer to a question
Like words to a love song
Like to a river to the red sea
Finding you is so hard
But loving you is easy
Loving you is easy, loving you is easy
Finding you is so hard
But loving you is easy
Loving you, I've been loving you
