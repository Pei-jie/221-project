One more nail in the coffin, one more foot in the grave
One more time I'm on my knees, as I try to walk away.

I've said it once, I've said it twice, I've said it a thousand fucking times.
That I'm ok, that I'm fine, that it's all just in my mind.
But this has got the best of me. and I can't seem to sleep.

I've said it once, I've said it twice, I've said it a thousand fucking times

It's because you never leave.
It's not because your not with me.
It's because you never leave.

Every second. Every minute. Every hour. Every day.
It never ends, it never ends
Every second. Every minute. Every hour. Every day.
It never ends, it never ends
