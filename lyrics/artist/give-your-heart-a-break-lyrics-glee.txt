[Rachel:]
The day I first met you
You told me you'd never fall in love
Now that I get you
I know fear is what it really was
Now here we are, so close
Yet so far, haven't I passed the test?
When will you realize
Baby, I'm not like the rest?
[Rachel and Brody:]
Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared, it's wrong
[Rachel:]
Like you might make a mistake
[Rachel and Brody:]
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to waste
[Rachel:]
To waste
[Rachel and Brody:]
So let me give your heart a break
[Brody:]
Give your heart a break
[Rachel:]
Let me give your heart a break
[Brody:]
Your heart a break
[Rachel:]
Oh yeah, yeah
[Brody:]
On Sunday, you went home alone
There were tears in your eyes
I called your cell phone, my love
But you did not reply
[Rachel and Brody:]
The world is ours if we want it
We can take it
[Rachel (Brody):]
If you just take my hand
There's no turning back now (There's
no turning back now)
Baby, try to understand
[Rachel and Brody:]
Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared, it's wrong
[Rachel:]
Like you might make a mistake
[Rachel and Brody:]
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to waste
[Rachel:]
To waste
[Rachel and Brody:]
So let me give your heart a break
[Brody:]
Give your heart a break
[Rachel:]
Let me give your heart a break
[Brody:]
Your heart a break
[Rachel:]
There's just so much you can take
[Brody:]
Give your heart a break
[Rachel:]
Let me give your heart a break
[Brody:]
Your heart a break
[Rachel:]
Oh yeah, yeah
When your lips are on my lips
[Rachel and Brody:]
And our hearts beat as one
[Rachel:]
But you slip out of my finger tips
[Rachel and Brody:]
Everytime you run
[Brody:]
Don't wanna break your heart
I wanna give your heart a break
[Rachel:]
I know you're scared, it's wrong
[Rachel and Brody:]
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to waste
[Brody:]
To waste
[Rachel and Brody:]
So let me give your heart a break
[Rachel (Brody):]
'Cause you've been hurt before (Give
your heart a break)
I can see it in your eyes (Give your
heart a break)
You try to smile away (Give your heart
a break)
Some things you can't disguise
[Rachel and Brody:]
Don't wanna break your heart
Maybe I can ease the ache! the ache!
So let me give your heart a break
[Brody (with Rachel harmonizing):]
Give your heart a break
Your heart a break
[Rachel and Brody:]
Your heart a break
There's just so much you can take,
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break
Your heart a break
Oh yeah, yeah
