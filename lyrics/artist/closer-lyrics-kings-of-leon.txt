rock
Stranded in this spooky town
Stoplight is swaying and the phone lines are down
This floor is crackling cold, she took my heart, I think she took my soul
With the moon I run far from the carnage of the fiery sun
Driven by the strangle of vein showing no mercy I do it again,
Open up your eye, you keep on crying baby, Ill bleed you dry
Skies they blink at me, I see a storm bubbling up from the sea
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer
You shimmy shook my boat leaving me stranded all in love on my own
Do you think of me? Where am I now? Baby where do I sleep?
Feel so good but I'm old, 2000 years of chasing taking its toll
And its coming closer
And its coming closer
And its coming closer
And its coming closer
