Now when the seasons change, oh, we don't stay the same
Oh, we could use a break from the hurt and pain
When the seasons change I know we can do the same
We can shed our leaves, some light we can grow today
When the seasons change
When it's spring, summer to the fall
Baby, by now we've been through it all
It ain't no summer if you be gone
And I know that we both can change
We need a change, yes
Said, we all can change
Don't be afraid of the change
No, no, oh no, oh, oh
Never tell the seasons change as we do too
Nothing remains the same, neither should me and you
Gotta have faith in the way, in the way that He moves
As the seasons change
We need a change, yes, we do
We all can change, yes, we can
And I know it's all in you and it's in me too
Now when the seasons change, oh we don't stay the same
Oh, we could use a break from all the hurt and pain
When the seasons change I know we can do the same
We can shed our leaves, some light we can grow today
When the seasons change
When it's spring, summer to the fall
Baby, by now we've been through it all
And it ain't no summer if you be gone
And I know that we both can change
Ain't no doubt in my mind, no, no
That we both can change
Now maybe we should change the flaws in ourselves
Sometimes we're not even real with ourselves
Every little change ain't perfect but I helps
We can do it and you know it and you see seasons change
When seasons change
Ain't afraid of change
We need a change
We all can change, oh, oh, oh
Said it's time for change
We need to change
When the seasons change
I ain't afraid to change
Oh, we need a change
We all can change
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
