LIAM PAYNE
I'm broken
Do you hear me
I'm blinded
Cause you are everything I see
I'm dancing, alone
I'm praying
That your heart will just turn around
And as I walk up to your door
My head turns to face the floor
Cause I can't look you in the eyes and say
HARRY STYLES
When he opens his arms
And holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
Cause I can love you more than this, yeah
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
Cause I can love you more than this
Can love you more than this
NIALL HORAN
If I'm louder
Would you see me?
Would you lay down in my arms and rescue me?
Cause we are, the same
You saved me, when you leave it's gone again
LOUIS TOMLINSON
And then I see you on the street
In his arms, I get weak
My body fails I'm on my knees
Praying
ALL
When he open his arms
And holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
Cause I can love you more than this, yeah
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
Cause I can love you more than this
ZAYN MALIK
I've never had the words to say
But now I'm asking you to stay
For a little while inside my arms
And as you close your eyes tonight
I pray that you will see the light
That's shining from the stars above
LIAM PAYNE
When he opens his arms
And holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
Cause I can love you more than this
ZAYN MALIK
Cause I can love you more than this
ALL
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
Cause I can love you more than this, yeah
When he opens his arms
And holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
Cause I can love you more than this
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
Cause I can love you more than this
ZAYN MALIK
Can love you more than this
