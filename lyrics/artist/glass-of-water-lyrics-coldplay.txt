Coldplay
rock
Scared of losin' all the time
He wrote it in a letter, he was a friend of mine
He heard you could see your future
Inside a glass of water with ripples and the lines
And he asked, "Will I see heaven in mine?"
That is just the way it was
Nothing could be better and nothing ever was
Oh, they say you can see your future
Inside a glass of water, the riddles and the rhymes
"Will I see heaven in mine?"
Oh, son, don't ask
Neither how full nor empty is your glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living in the past
Going nowhere fast
So he wrote it on a wall
The hollowest of halos is no halo at all
Televisions selling plastic figurines of leaders
Saying nothing at all
And you chime, stars in heaven align
Oh, son, don't ask
Neither how full nor empty is your glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living in the past
Going nowhere fast
What are we drinking when we're done?
Glasses of water
