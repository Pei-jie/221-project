For those days we felt like a mistake
Those times when loves what you hate
somehow
we keep marchin on
For those nights that i couldn't be there,
I've made it harder to know that you know
That somehow
We'll keep movin' on
There's so many wars we fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have
I promise you that
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on
There's so many wars we fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have
I promise you that
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on
So many hills we had to climb
almost without our strength
but we kept
slowly marchin on
time heals the wounds we couldnt close
blood sweat and tears dried up
we're okay
we kept marchin on
There's so many wars we fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have
I promise you that
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on
There's so many wars we fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have
I promise you that
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on
get your legs and walk
cause we're not too far
a little more to go
but we're marchin on
we marchin on
we marchin on
we marchin on
we marchin
if we lose the sun we couldnt deny that
if we go the wind we gotta fight back
but we marchin on
we marchin on
we marchin on
we marchin
the bridges are gone
and we're almost home
the end is close
There's so many wars we fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have
I promise you that
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on
There's so many wars we fought
There's so many things we're not
But with what we have
I promise you that
We're marchin' on
We're marchin' on
