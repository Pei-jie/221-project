[Verse 1]
I'd given up on love
I'd given up on me
Everything for you was never as it seemed
I was running out of reasons
I was running out of time
I thought I'd stopped believing
Then you showed me the light
[Chorus]
You found me in the darkest night
You're my angel
You saved my life
I can't believe we're standing here
What's mine is yours, and yours is mine
I love you till the end of time
I wanna spend forever with you
I do
I do
I do
[Verse 2]
I can see us
Growing old and grey
Standing beside you
When we walk through heaven's gates
Cause soulmates live together
From one life to the next
We'll always be together
I promise you this
[Chorus]
You found me in the darkest night
You're my angel
You saved my life
I can't believe we're standing here
What's mine is yours, and yours is mine
I love you till the end of time
I wanna spend forever with you
I do
I do
I do
[Bridge]
They always say "you'll know when you know"
I didn't know it could feel like this
With every touch, with every kiss
You found me in the darkest night
You're my angel
You saved my life
I can't believe we're standing here
[Chorus]
You found me in the darkest night
You're my angel
You saved my life
I can't believe we're standing here
What's mine is yours, and yours is mine
I love you till the end of time
I wanna spend forever with you
I do
I do
I do
