Twisted,
You've shaken my exsistence,
When I'm with you baby bliss is,
(I want you)
All I've come to know
(Come to me)
Running,
I didn't see it coming,
Blinded it's so stunning,
I don't wanna let you go
A thousand church bells ringing,
I can hear the angels singing,
When you call my name,
Your love is off the chain
(Off the chain, chain, off the chain, chain)
The chemistry is crazy,
And you make me feel amazing,
And I can't explain,
Your love is off the chain
(Off the chain, chain, off the chain, chain)
Your love, your love, your love,
Your love, your love, your love
Coming,
Just keep the magic coming,
You've got me baby crushing,
But it feels like so much more
Just when,
When I least expect it,
You make it feel so epic,
Like nothing i've felt before
A thousand church bells ringing,
I can hear the angels singing,
When you call my name,
Your love is off the chain
(Off the chain, chain, off the chain, chain)
The chemistry is crazy,
And you make me feel amazing,
And I can't explain,
Your love is off the chain
(Off the chain, chain, off the chain, chain)
Your love, your love, your love,
Your love, your love, your love
I'm not the type who gets crazy for someone,
Odds of me, tripping are like next to nothing,
Guarded my heart like a diamond ring,
But love, your love changes everything
Everything is changed,
Everything is changed,
Everything is changed,
Your love is off the chain
Oh, Everything is changed,
Everything is changed,
Now everything is changed,
Your l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l
A thousand church bells ringing,
I can hear the angels singing,
When you call my name,
Your love is off the chain
(Off the chain, chain, off that chain, chain)
The chemistry is crazy,
And you make me feel amazing,
And I can't explain,
Your love is off the chain
(Off the chain, chain, off the chain, chain)
Your love, your love, your love,
Your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love, love,
(Off the chain, chain)
Your love, your love, your love, love,
(Off the chain, chain)
Your love, your love, your love, love
(Off the chain)
