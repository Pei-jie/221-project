You reeled me in with your smile
You made me melt with your voice
Now I've been gone now for a while
Just to find that I'm your seventh choice
And I don't wanna pay the cost
But it'd be best if you get lost
Because we know you'll never change
[Chorus]
Don't say that you need me
And don't play these games with my mind
You better get outta my head cause you're wastin' your time
And don't say it's forever
And don't play, cause you had your shot
You better stop messin' around cause you're gonna get caught
You promised me all of your time
I guess I'm not the only one
But see it's my heart on the line this time
I'm your number one or I'm gone
{CHORUS}
Don't say that you need me
And don't play these games with my mind
You better get outta my head cause you're wastin' your time
And don't say it's forever
And don't play, cause you had your shot
You better stop messin' around cause you're gonna get caught
Go and try to get me back
(You won't get me back, you won't get me back)
I won't forget about our past (I won't forget now)
Never had the guts to leave, now you're making it
(You know you're making it)
Now your making it much easier for me to see
Don't say that you're sorry
For breaking every inch of my heart
I should've known from the start
Now it's time to get lost
{CHORUS}
And don't say that you need me
And don't play these games with my mind
You better get outta my head cause you're wasting your time
Don't say it's forever
And don't play, cause you had your shot
You better stop messin' around cause you're gonna get caught
You better stop messin' around cause you're gonna get caught
