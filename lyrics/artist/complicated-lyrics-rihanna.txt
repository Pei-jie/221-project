You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you
While I hate it?
'Cause if you really wanna be alone I
Would throw my hands up 'cause baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?
Sometimes I get you
Sometimes I don't understand
Sometimes I love you
Sometimes it's you I can't stand
Sometimes I wanna hug you
Sometimes I wanna push you away
Most times I wanna kiss you
Other times put you
And every minute you start switching up
And you say things like you don't give a fuck
Then I say, I'm through with you, take my heart from you
And you come running after me and baby, I'm back with you, oh
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you
While I hate it?
'Cause if you really wanna be alone I
Would throw my hands up 'cause baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?
Sometimes I catch you
Sometimes you get away
Sometimes I read you
Other times I'm like, where are you on the page?
Sometimes I feel like
We will be together forever
But you're so complicated
My heart and all is bitter
Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you
While I hate it?
'Cause if you really wanna be alone I
Would throw my hands up 'cause baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?
I'mma stick around just a little while longer
Just to make sure, that you're really sure, you like sleeping alone
I'mma stick around just a little while longer
Just to make sure, that you're really sure, you like sleeping alone
Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you
Why I hate it?
'Cause if you really wanna be alone I
Would throw my hands up 'cause baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
