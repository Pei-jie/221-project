There's only so many songs that I can sing
To pass the time
And I'm running outta things
To do to get you off my mind
(Oh)
All I have is this picture in a frame
That I hold close to see your face everyday
With you is where I'd rather be
But we're stuck where we are and it's so hard
So far, this long distance is killing me
I wish that you were here with me
But we're stuck where we are and it's so hard
So far, this long distance is killing me
It's so hard
(So hard)
When we are
(When we are)
We're so far, this long distance is killing me
It's so hard
(So hard)
When we are
(When we are)
So far, this long distance is killing me
Now the minutes feel like hours
And the hours feel like days while I'm away
You know right now I can't be home
But I'm coming home soon, coming home soon
All I have is this picture in a frame
That I hold close to see your face again
With you is where I'd rather be
But we're stuck where we are and it's so hard
So far, this long distance is killing me
I wish that you were here with me
But we're stuck where we are and it's so hard
So far
Can you hear me crying?
(Ooh)
Can you hear me crying?
(Ooh)
Can you hear me crying?
(Ooh)
With you is where I'd rather be
But we're stuck where we are and it's so hard
So far, this long distance is killing me
I wish that you were here with me
But we're stuck where we are and it's so hard
So far, it's so hard
(So hard)
When we are
(When we are)
We're so far this long distance is killing me
It's so hard
(So hard)
When we are
(When we are)
So far, this long distance is killing me
There's only so many songs that I can sing
To pass the time
