B.O.B.
hiphop
[Chorus - B.O.B]
Just because Im losing doesnt mean Im lost
They gave me nothing but doubt
first they waited then hated then counted me out
Just because Im losing doesnt mean Im stuck
They say I lost my way
but first I showed em then I sold em right in front of their face
[Verse 1 - B.O.B]
Well this is the World that we living
one minute you the hero the next you the villain
we got up in this game just to try to make a living
we hit you with the truth while you watching television
but still these are the cards that we dealt
they kick you on the ground when you most need help
until you dried up and they sit you on the shelf
then you start to cry because you all by yourself
so just know if you are aware of the belt
the only way to excel is the soul that you sell
so I could care less about the clothes on myself
Im trying to drive straight on a road made of nails
yeah, I got to pay the toll if I fell
or else it would be another story to tell
Im getting to the door I can tell
Im just waiting on the day till the glory prevails
[Chorus]
[Verse 2 - T.I.]
All I know is keep going, sh-t dont stop
until the huss double up put the click on top
used to wanna have the bricks on lock
til we went to prison saw we couldnt pick them locks
easy decision now a n-gga think I lost my touch
listen if I aint the realest ever done it I aint off by much
so please dont wake me up if Im dreaming in the fast lane speedin no safety belt
and its a marathon pace yourself
in this race for wealth talkin sh-t just a waste of breath
chasing me like chasing your tail your never gon catch it
respect is something you never get if you never had it
Im looking back and laughing this life of mine
bought me all the way here form my life of crime
just a constant reminder that the end Ill be always the one who knows all sees all
because
[Chorus]
[Verse 3 - B.o.B]
Yeah, well these are my predictions
Ill be on the top 40 with a big hit
travelling the World trying not to get sick
and Ima get more friends on my friends list
and then after that Ill be famous
and everyone I know will tell me that Im changing
and then my cell phone will never stop ringing
and Ill be all over magazine pages
yeah and theyll play my songs till they boring
and if I ever do stop touring they treat me like a foreigner
Dont believe me ask Lauren
[Chorus]
