De gal them rush to feel the I'll touch
Gal them ball and gal them a scream
De think ita love but a lust
That's why a bad gal beside is a must for I bust
She's the angel of me conscious yo, yo, yo
Never thought that I could feel somethin' so strong
I wanna hold on to this moment before it's gone
I wanna hold your body close its callin' to me
And when I look into your eyes, I'm likin' what I see
Boy don't hold back from me
Just give me everything you got
I wonder, I can keep
I know your gonna keep it hot
I catch a rush boy whenever we touch I go crazy
I'm feelin' you baby
I trip like this boy whenever we kiss, I can't take it
You know I can't fake it
Yo, yo, yo
Well, I'm back with the boys and I knowin' dat
Don't watch my face my gal you know I'm coming back
Most of mea gal them slide off easy like a thunder clap
When I see you from the back you know me need all a dat yo, yo, yo
Don't even know your name but this feels so right
It's like I known you boy for all of my life
Don't need to say a word, we both understand
And my eyes are tellin' you catch me if you can
I'm fallin' faster now
You know you got me where you want
Too late, I can't slow down
No way, we're ever gonna stop
I catch a rush boy whenever we touch I go crazy
I'm feelin' you baby
I trip like this boy whenever we kiss, I can't take it
You know, I can't fake it
No, I can't take it
No, I can't fake it
No, no
My girl, turn it around and cut it out
And come a little close so you feel what I'm 'bout here
No, I can't take it

No, no
My girl, turn it around bring it near
Let me show you a thing dat a done ya career
I'm fallin' faster now
You know you got me where you want
Too late, I can't slow down
No way, we're ever gonna stop
I catch a rush boy whenever we touch I go crazy
I'm feelin' you baby
I trip like this boy whenever we kiss, I can't take it
You know, I can't fake it
I catch a rush boy whenever we touch I go crazy
I'm feelin' you baby
I trip like this boy whenever we kiss, I can't take it
You know, I can't fake it
