[** feat. Philip Lawrence:]
Her Heart Is Racing*
And The Room Is Heating Up
And Her Eyes Are Glazing
But She Still Can't Get Enough
The Beat Is Bumping Now Shes Blowing Up Blowing Up
The Last Thing On Her Mind is Growing Up Growing Up
She'll Kiss The Sky Before Shes Giving up Giving Up
Ooh Here She Comes
Shes Dancing With The Stars
Living In The Sky With Diamonds
Ooh Shes Dancing With The Stars
And Oh How The Lights Are Shining
She Builds Castles With White Sand
The Reflection In The Mirror Is Her Best Friend
Ooh Shes Dancing With The Stars
The Stars
Keep Dancing
You Can't Change Her Cause She Knows You Think It's Hard
That Girl Knows Danger And She Don't When To Start
The Beat Is Bumping Now Shes Blowing Up Blowing Up
The Last Thing On Her Mind is Growing Up Growing Up
She'll Kiss The Sky Before Shes Giving up Giving Up
Ooh Here She Comes
Shes Dancing With The Stars
Living In The Sky With Diamonds
Ooh Shes Dancing With The Stars
And Oh How The Lights Are Shining
She Builds Castles With White Sand
The Reflection In The Mirror Is Her Best Friend
Ooh Shes Dancing With The Stars
The Stars
Keep Dancing
