I'm only, I'm only human dawg
(Hello out there)
I'm only human dawg
(Can you hear me?)
I'm only human dawg
(It's an SOS to let me be me)
I'm only human dawg, ay, ay, ay listen to me
And when they push you down, you got to get back up
And when they push you down, you got to get back up
Push the dirt off your jersey, then go for the cup
Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what
'Cause when you got the belt and the ring
People with ya poppin' bottles, takin' pictures, look around
As soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgment
All eyes on me, I'm here to show that I'ma rise above this
Hey, what a deal world, yeah it's me again
Back before you, at your mercy, on bended knee again
No running from the truth as much as we pretend
That it ain't what it is, then it hits CNN
Apologies to my fans and my closest friends
For letting you down, I won't take you down this road again
Most of you now saying, "Whatever, here we go again"
Blogs, radio, and television all going in
I laugh to keep from crying through all of the embarrassment
I gotta say you fucking haters is hilarious
How dare you sit right there and act as if you holier than thou
Point your finger now with me looking down
Same clown that was twitpicking at my wedding
On the same Twitter page disrespecting, wait a second
Never mind my imperfections this is fact, remember that
No mistake's too great to recover and bounce back
And when they push you down, you got to get back up
And when they push you down, you got to get back up
Push the dirt off your jersey, then go for the cup
Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what
'Cause when you got the belt and the ring
People with ya poppin' bottles, takin' pictures, look around
As soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgment
All eyes on me, I'm here to show that I'ma rise above this
I admit, yeah, I done some dumb shit, disappointed everybody I know
Try not to hold that against me though
My road to redemption has no GPS
So guess the time must be invested for this to be manifested
Yes it's hard living life in the spotlight
Trying to dodge the haters same time as the cop light
The Bible say, "Let he without sin cast the stone first"
The sinner or the one who judged him, who was wrong first?
Yeah he go to work, never done no drugs up until the affair
He just drink his liquor, touch his kids, beat his wife instead
Difference is, my shortcomings hit the media
Thanks to TMZ, the AJC and Wikipedia
See the stairway to heaven while stepping down Jacob's ladder
My good outweigh the bad, God, ain't that what really matter?
A matter of fact I'm wrong but after that
The good I've done in your 'hood, should it overshadow that?
Got the world laughing at me for the moment
But it gonna be your turn 'fore it's over with
Even if you so legit that you get a house with a dog and a picket fence
The people with you then, but when they turn on you remember this
And when they push you down, you got to get back up
And when they push you down, you got to get back up
Push the dirt off your jersey, then go for the cup
Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what
'Cause when you got the belt and the ring
People with ya poppin' bottles, takin' pictures, look around
As soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgment
All eyes on me, I'm here to show that I'ma rise above this
Hello, out there, can you hear me? Can you hear me?
It's an SOS to let me be me
Hello, out there, can you hear me?
You gotta get, you gotta gotta believe in me, hey
Hello, out there, can you hear me?
It's an SOS to let me be me
I accept full responsibility for the all the wrong I've done
If y'all thought I were perfect
I apologize for being human man
But never again partner, You can put my life on that
And when they push you down, you got to get back up
And when they push you down, you got to get back up
Push the dirt off your jersey, then go for the cup
Or the trophy or the ring, champion no matter what
'Cause when you got the belt and the ring
People with ya poppin' bottles, takin' pictures, look around
As soon as you fall down all the haters pass a judgment
All eyes on me, I'm here to show that I'ma rise above this
And you can love me, or you can leave me
Before you judge me, just let me be me
And you can love me or either leave me
Before you judge me, see life ain't easy
