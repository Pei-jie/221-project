I would give up everything
Before Id separate myself from you
After so much suffering
Ive finally found a man thats true
I was all by myself for the longest time
So cold inside and the hurt from the heart
It would not subside
I felt like dying until you saved my life
Thank God, I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
Im overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby, Im so thankful I found you
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
I will give you everything
Theres nothing in this world I wouldnt do
To ensure your happiness
Ill cherish every part of you
Because without you beside me
I cant survive, I dont wanna try
If youre keeping me warm each and every night
Ill be all right 'cause I need you in my life, oh
Thank God, I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
Im overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby, Im so thankful, I found you, oh
See I was so desolate
Before you came to me
Looking back I guess it shows
That we were destined to shine
After the rain to appreciate
And care for what we have
And I go through it all over again
To be able to feel this way
Thank God, I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
Im overwhelmed with gratitude
Sweet baby Im so thankful, I found you, oh
Thank God, I found you
I was lost without you
Im overwhelmed with gratitude
My baby Im so thankful, I found you, you
Im overwhelmed with gratitude
My baby, Im so thankful I found you
