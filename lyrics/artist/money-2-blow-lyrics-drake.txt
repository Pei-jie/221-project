[Verse]
I am on a 24 hour
Champagne diet spillin' while I'm sippin'
I encourage you to try it
I'm probably just sayin' that cause I don't have to buy it
The club owner supply it
Boy I'm on that fly shit
I am, what everybody in my past don't want me to be
Guess what, I made it
I'm da Mo' fuckin' man
I just want you to see
Come take a look, get a load of dis nigga
Quit frontin' on me
Don't come around and try to gas me up I like runnin' on E,
I I I I'm on my Disney shit
Goofy flow on records I'm Captin Hook
And my new car is Rufio
Damn, where my roof just go
I'm somebody that you should know
Get to shakin' somethin' cause that's what Druma' produced it fo'
Yes I make mistakes, that I don't ever make excuses for
Like leavin' girls that love me and constantly seducing hoes
I'm losing my thoughts, I said damn where my roof just go
Top slipped off like Janet at the Super Bowl
[Hook]
I got 'em
they can't help it, and I can't blame 'em
Since I got famous, bitch! I got money to blow
Gettin' it in, lettin' these bills fall
All over your skin
Got money to blow ho ho oh ho ho oh
