pop
If you want me
The cherry on top
The pick of the pack
The cr√©me de la crop
If you want me you better do better than that tonight
Oh oh
If you want me
It takes more than a wink
More than a drink
More than you think
If you want me you're gonna have to break the bank tonight
Cause some don't have the patience
Some call me high maintenance
But you pay the bill
Cause that's the deal
(Chorus)
If you wanna ride
Just name your price
Dont play cheap with your heart
Dont make a bet
If you cant write the check
For me, for me
Cause I can be bought but youll pay the cost
If you can afford me
If you want me
Im not a piece of ass
A one night stand
A storage shed
I think you better walk by tonight
Oh no
If you want me
Then stop begging
I dont put out for charity
If you want me theres no discount price
Tonight
But I dont need your dollar bills
I just want something real
Cause nothing's free
Except loving me
(Chorus)
If you want me
The cherry on top
The pick of the pack
The crme de la crop
(Chorus) x2
