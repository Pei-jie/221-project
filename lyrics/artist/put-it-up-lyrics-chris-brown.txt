Dis be dat turnt up music (Have you turnt your levels)
Go ahead and jump into it (Feel it in your system)
You see this turnt up music (Gotcha on the edge)
Step the fuck off that building (Don't stand on the ledge)
Now I'm feeling, it's tryna kick in, swagger turnt up, on ten now that's chillin,
I think I'm 'bout to hard tonight, I think I'm 'bout to hard tonight,
Won't quit it, get it how I'm living, so I'm bouncing off the walls,
You should know that I'm like a radio, I'm turnt up everywhere I go,
Tryna get on the level with the music turnt up yea yea
And I've been drinkin a lil bit, so you can tell that I'm feelin it, ain't no turning me down,
Cause I'm way to turnt up, noooooow
Just like the music
It's time to FIU it, (go and fuck it up yea)
Go dumb even go stupid, (whyl' out in this club yea)
Dj killin the music, (bump'a ow bump'a ow ow yea)
Cuz you fine as ever,
Girl you better,
Take it to the floor.
Now I'm feeling, it's tryna kick in, swagger turnt up, on ten now that's chillin,
