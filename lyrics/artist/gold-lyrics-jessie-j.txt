[Verse 1]
Everyone dies but not everyone lives
Everyone takes but not everyone gives
I wanna see my name written across the sky
I'm not going up in flames I choose to survive
[Pre 1]
So tonight we dance this rhythm
Till the light of morning hits us
We may never see a moment
As magical as this one
[Chorus 1]
Like gold
You make me feel like gold
You make me feel like gold
You make me feel like gold
Show me love like I've never known
Baby you make me feel like gold
[Verse 2]
Some people wait for love to come
Till it's too late that won't be us
'Coz there's an energy pulling me to you
We are two hearts beating together now it's true
Woah oh oh
[Pre 2]
So tonight we dance this rhythm
Till the light of morning hits us
We may never see a moment
As magical as this one
[Chorus 2]
Like gold
You make me feel like gold
You make me feel like gold
You make me feel like gold
Show me love like I've never known
Baby you make me feel like gold
[Bridge 1]
The way you make me feel you know it really tears me up
And every single day i pray I always give enough
'Coz baby how you saved my life it's love and it's fact and I just wanna give it all back
[Chorus 3]
Like gold
You make me feel like gold
You make me feel like gold
You make me feel like gold
Show me love like I've never known
Baby you make me feel like gold
