A few drinks in a Friday night
We only came to dry your eyes
And get you out of your room
Now these sparks closes doors
I found my hand is on yours
Do you wanna go home so soon?
Or maybe we should take a ride through the night
And sing along to every song that's on the radio
In the back of the taxi cab in Brooklyn, no, no
Sun can rise burning all the street lamps out
3 AM, so DJ, play it again
Til the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
And we'll keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kiss you darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start of everything you want
New love, New York
New York
Yesterday gave me a call
Stressing out about it all
The world is moving too fast
But you don't know where to begin
Cuz you spent a lifetime fitting in
Leave the weight out on the outside
By yourself, everyday
Screaming out to all the people that you used to know
From the window that looks upon the Manhattan skyline
It's just the way that life goes
And you hear it in every song you know
DJ, play it again
Til the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
And we'll keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kiss you darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start of everything you want
New love, New York
And every song that plays
it's just like the day you had
And it's ok to cry
When I'm saying maybe die
It's a waste of war
You know I'm here for you
In the back of the taxi cab tonight
And New York has just reached the morning
You're still in my arms
Now we stopped driving along the boulevard
And I just kissed you darling
I hope you weren't alarmed
It's just the start of everything you want
A new love, New York
A new life, New York
