pop
(Verse)
You hate the sand between your toes
I like the beach on a sunny day
I like pink margaritas, it appears you like beer
I like a foreign accent
You just say What? What the hell they say?
We got different perspectives
Night and day, but thats okay
(Chorus)
Sometimes I like to trade you in
For someone more like me
You tell me I was right again
We get on famously
Life would be boring without you to disagree
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Verse)
You like to fight in silence
I like to scream while Im breaking plates
You like the heavy metal
But I like songs to sing along to
(Chorus)
Sometimes I like to trade you in
For someone more like me
You tell me I was right again
We get on famously
Life would be boring without you to disagree
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
(Bridge)
And I will, but you wont
And I do, but, but you dont
We wont budge either way
But we like it, we like it
(Chorus)
Sometimes I like to trade you in
For someone more like me
You tell me I was right again
We get on famously
Life would be boring without you to disagree
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(We agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Lets agree to disagree)
Yeah yeah yeah
