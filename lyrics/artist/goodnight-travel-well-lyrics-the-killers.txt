rock
The unknown distance to the gray beyond
Stares back at my grieving frame
To cast my shadow by the holy sun
My spirit moans with a sacred pain
It's quiet now
The universe is standing still
There's nothin' I can say
There's nothin' we can do now
There's nothin' I can say
There's nothin' we can do now
And all that stands between the soul's release
This temporary flesh and bone
And know that it's over now
I feel my faded mind begin to roam
Every time you fall and every time you try
Every foolish dream and every compromise
Every word you spoke and everything you said
Everything you left me, rambles in my head
And there's nothing I can say
There's nothing I can do now
There's nothing I can say
There's nothing I can do now
Up above the world so high
Everything you loved and every time you try
Everybody's watching and everybody cry
Stay, don't leave me, the stars can wait for your sign
Don't signal now
And there's nothing I can say
There's nothing I can do now
And there's nothing I can say
There's nothing we can do now
Goodnight, travel well
Goodnight, travel well
There's nothing I can say
Nothing I can do now
Goodnight, travel well, travel well
Travel well
