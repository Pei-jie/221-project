Shwayze
hiphop
I aint been sleeping, Im living my dream, yes Im the act
Aint no such thing as to turn me when I get on my path
Remember when it was her and me, she made me relax
Stole my heart like burglary and then give it back
Introduced me to music, fell in love with the track
Had a crush on the beat, the snare and the high hat
In the bedroom Im thinking the hook lines
Im laughing at the jokes and I dont even know the punch lines
Knew it was finished when I missed the anniversary dinner
Maybe yo momma was right, you can do better
Id rather make music than to spend time with you
And the melody is telling me
I wont go
I cant do it on my own
If this aint love, then what is?
Im willing to take the risk
[x2]
You do you and Ill do better than expected
One of the only rappers since Pac with a message
And that message is to give without question
And what you earn in return
Would be better than you projected
Now, thats my PSA for the day, Im living man
And its not cause Im getting paid
Some days I meditate under the sun rays
Thanking for a Sunday I aint stuck on a run way
I love it dough but I also love the booth
I call that shit confession cause I always speak the truth
Play a crowd of ten thou but feel like me and you
And the melody is telling me
I wont go
I cant do it on my own
If this aint love, then what is?
Im willing to take the risk
