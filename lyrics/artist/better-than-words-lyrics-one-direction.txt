[Harry]
Better than words
More than a feeling
Crazy in love
Dancing on the ceiling
[Liam]
Everytime we touch i'm all shook up
You make me wanna... how deep is your love
God only knows... Baby
Chorus
Oh I don't know how else to sum it up
Cause words ain't good enough
There's no way i can explain your love... no
Oh I don't know how else to sum it up
Cause words ain't good enough
Oh I can't explain your love... no
It's better than words x2
[Louis]
Better than words
you drive me crazy
someone like you
always be my baby
[Niall]
Best i ever had hips don't lie
make me wanna ... one more night
irreplaceable... crazy
(Chorus)
Oh I don't know how else to sum it up
Cause words ain't good enough
There's no way i can explain your love... no
Oh I don't know how else to sum it up
Cause words ain't good enough
Oh I can't explain your love... no
Bridge
Everyone tries to see what it feels like
but they'll never be right cuz it's better
(Chorus)
Oh I don't know how else to sum it up
Cause words ain't good enough
There's no way i can explain your love... no
Oh I don't know how else to sum it up
Cause words ain't good enough
Oh I can't explain your love... no
It's better than words x3
