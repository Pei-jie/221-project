This kicked im
Got your tongue tied in knots, I see
Spit it out
'Cause I'm dying for company
I notice that you got it
You notice that I want it
You know that I can take it
To the next level baby
If you want this good s-t
Sicker than the remix
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight
I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
Come on, get me, get me on the floor
DJ, what you, what you waiting for?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Watch me move
When I lose, when I lose it hard
Get you off
With a touch, dancing in the dark
You notice what I'm wearing
I'm noticing you staring
You know that I can take it
To the next level, baby
Hotter than the A-list
Next one on my hit list
Baby, let me blow your mind tonight
I can't take it, take it, take no more
Never felt like, felt like this before
Come on, get me, get me on the floor
DJ, what you, what you waiting for?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
See the sunlight, we ain't stopping
Keep on dancing ?till the world ends
If you feel it, let it happen
Keep on dancing ?till the world ends
Keep on dancing ?till the world ends
(World ends, world ends, world ends?)
Keep on dancing ?till the world ends
(World ends, world ends, world ends?)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
See the sunlight, we ain't stopping
Keep on dancing ?till the world ends
If you feel it, let it happen
Keep on dancing ?till the world ends
(World ends, world ends)
