Paramore
rock
Close your eyes and make believe
This is where you wanna be
Forgetting all the memories
Try to forget love 'cause love's forgotten me
Well, hey, hey, baby, it's never too late
Pretty soon you won't remember a thing
And I'll be as distant as stars
Reminiscing, your heart's been wasted on me
You've never been so used as I'm using you, abusing you
My little decoy, don't look so blue
You should have seen right through
I'm using you
My little decoy
My little decoy
Living life inside a dream
Time is changing everything
Forgetting all the memories
And I'm forced into you
Just cause you're into me
Well, hey, hey, baby, it's never too late
When I'm gone you won't remember a thing
But I can't stay and no, I won't wait
I was gone from the very first day
You've never been so used as I'm using you, abusing you
My little decoy, don't look so blue
You should have seen right through
I'm using you
My little decoy
I'm not sorry at all
(Not sorry at all, not sorry)
No, I won't be sorry at all
(Not sorry at all, not sorry, no)
I'd do it over again
(Don't look so blue)
My little decoy
(You should have seen right through)
My little decoy
(You've never been so used)
My little decoy
(As I'm using you)
My little decoy
