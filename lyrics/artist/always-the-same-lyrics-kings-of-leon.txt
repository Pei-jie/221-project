I don't know where I'm gonna go,
But it don't matter to me
'Cause it's always this way,
And I'm always the same
I'm not a man, everybody said,
But it don't matter to me
I'll break my heart, tear it apart,
It don't matter to me, no no
I put a shine in your eye,
It don't matter to me
'Cause it's always this way,
And I'm always the same
