His after moan though cries oh no
He's building up a shine but he take it slow
And he knows it's time to make a change here
And time to get away
It's time for all the wrong reasons
Time to end the pain
But he sleep all, we sleep all day
Sleep all, we sleep all day over
Why don't we sleep all, we sleep all day
Sleep all, we sleep all day over?
She said what would your mother think of all this
How would your father react, oh Lord?
Would he take it all back what they've done
The way they said take it, take it?
And he said make it with your own two hands
That was my old man and he said
"If all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of it"
Oh what a lovely day to slip inside a humbled mind
Oh recalling of the while we used to drive and drive here and there
Going nowhere but for us, nowhere but the two of us
And we knew it was time to take a chance here
In time to compromise our lives just a little while
And it was time for all the wrong and, lonely lonesome reasons
But time is often upon my side I'm gonna give it to you tonight
And we sleep all, we sleep all day
Sleep all, we sleep all day over
Why don't we sleep all, we sleep all day
We sleep all, we sleep all day
Over and over over and over again?
As time goes by we get a little bit tired of waking
And baked another Marlboro mile wide
It's sending the boys on the run in the time in the hot summer sun
To swim beneath or over outside
Still they're reading between the lines
But they remember the part in the Hallmark Card
Where they read about the dreams
And reaching for the stars to hold on a little bit closer to
And they knew it was time, time to take
And take love time to chance here
Time to compromise our to occupy their lives
And it was time for all the wrong reasons so
But the time is often upon my side and I give it to you, oh boy
And we sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all
We sleep all day over and in the end it is okay
Why don't we sleep all, we sleep all day
We sleep all, we sleep all day over and over?
She said what would your mother think of all this
How would your father react, oh Lord?
Would he take it all back what they've done
The way he said take it, take it?
And don't break it with your own two hands
That was my old man and he said
"If all, all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of it"
Love to make a mountain
Go on and on and on and on
Where you should go on make a mountain out of it and love
Go on and go on and go on and
Go on and make a mountain
Go on and make a mountain
Go on
You should go on and make a mountain
Out of it
