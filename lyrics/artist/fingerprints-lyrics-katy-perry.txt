Voted most likely to end up
On the back of a milk box drink
Looks like I'm lettin 'em down
'Cause seven seventy-five isn't worth
An hour of my hard working time
When you can't afford half the shit they advertise
Oh, I'm worth more than they ask
More than the toe-tag generation full of regrets
Oh, I won't settle no-o, oh, I can't settle
I wanna break the mold
Wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air
I'm not going down without a fight
It's my life and I'm not sitting
On the sidelines watching it
Pass me by, I'm leaving you my legacy I
I gotta make my mark, I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints on you
Representing you and me
Don't you wanna go down in history?
Rather than end up begging on the streets
Trading under table favors for a place to sleep
'Cause I'm worth more than this
So stop writing prescriptions for more Ritalin
I can focus my attention
I wanna break the mold
Wanna break the stereotype
Fist in the air
I'm not going down without a fight
It's my life and I'm not sitting
On the sidelines watching it
Pass me by, I'm leaving you my legacy I
I gotta make my mark, I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints..
Don't give up, but don't give in
Build your house on the rock
Oh, not in the sand, in the sand
In the sand, in the sand...
It's my life and I'm not sitting
On the sidelines watching it
Pass me by, I'm leaving you my legacy
I, I gotta make my mark, I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
It's my life and I'm not sitting
On the sidelines watching
It pass me by, I'm leaving you my legacy
I, I gotta make my mark, I gotta run it hard
I want you to remember me
'Cause I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints
I'm leaving my fingerprints in the END.
