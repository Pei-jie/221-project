I had a dream I was a dove
Up in the sky, way up above
And you were there, lifted your hands up
But then I saw a raven's nest
He lured me in, he gave me rest
I looked around for you at once, but you were gone
But Now I See
You're the one for me, I see
You're the one for me
That day I flew across the lands
Of raging storms and burning sands
I found your door, and here I stand
My desert man
But Now I See
You're the one for me, I see
You're the one for me, I see
You're the one for me, I see
You're the one for me
