Adele
pop
I'm insane in the brain
You're not already...
Feel the pain burning through vain
So piss me off, pretentious, ostentatious
Other words are spring to me
... emolicious, for the shoot posses no...
And you want me to respect you
And have... for yourself
You're out of control with nobody around to help
Help, help oh oh.
Chorus:
This time you're on your own
Running about the mammy hoping that she's home
But if she's not there and you're on your alone
So... you then go calling
Fiasco, call it fiasco, fiasco
... fiasco, fiasco,... fiasco
1 2 3 4.
Hustle...
Wanna try to testify in a... of happiness
Be the best, have success,
Doesn't mean you're Hollywood
Feel blessed not impressed
By the glamour if you think you could.
And you want me to respect you
And have... for yourself
You're out of control with nobody around to help
Help, help oh oh.
Chorus:
This time you're on your own
Running about the mammy hoping that she's home
But if she's not there and you're on your alone
So... you then go calling
Fiasco, call it fiasco, fiasco
... fiasco, fiasco,... fiasco
1 2 3 4.
Fiasco, fiasco
[Chorus:]
1 2 3 4
I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling it fiasco,
I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling it fiasco,
I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling it fiasco.
