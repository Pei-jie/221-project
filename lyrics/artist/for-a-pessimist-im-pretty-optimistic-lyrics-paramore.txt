Just talk yourself up and tear yourself down
You've hit your one wall, now find a way around
Well, what's the problem? You got a lot of nerve
So what did you think I would say?
No, you can't run away, no, you can't run away
So what did you think I would say?
No, you can't run away, no, you can't run away
You wouldn't
I never wanted to say this
You never wanted to stay
I put my faith in you, so much faith
And then you just threw it away
You threw it away
I'm not so naive, my sorry eyes can see
The way you fight shy of almost everything
Well, if you give up, you'll get what you deserve
So what did you think I would say?
No, you can't run away, no, you can't run away
So what did you think I would say?
No, you can't run away, no, you can't run away
You wouldn't
I never wanted to say this
You never wanted to stay
I put my faith in you, so much faith
And then you just threw it away
You threw it away
You were finished long before
We had even seen the start
Why don't you stand up? Be a man about it
Fight with your bare hands about it now
I never wanted to say this
You never wanted to stay, well did you?
I put my faith in you, so much faith
And then you just threw it away
I never wanted to say this
You never wanted to stay
I put my faith in you, so much faith
And then you just threw it away
