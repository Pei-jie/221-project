Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
You're asking me, will my love grow?
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around now it may show
I don't know, I don't know
No I love that woman mine
And I need her all of the time
No I'm telling you
That woman, that woman
Don't make me blue
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
