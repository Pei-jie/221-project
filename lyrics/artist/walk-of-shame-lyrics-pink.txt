Pink
pop
One step, two steps,
Counting tiles on the floor.
Three steps, four steps,
Guess this means that I'm a whore.
Oh oh, hell no,
How long till I reach the door?
Fuck me, my feet are sore
I'm wearing last night's dress
And I look like a hot ass mess
Although my hair looks good
'cause I haven't slept yet.
Make the elevator come a little faster.
I'm pushing all the buttons
But nothing's happening
Please, God, don't let anybody see me
Please, God, I'll do anything you ask me
I promise no more walks of shame
So walk this way
(We're walking, we're walking)
Walk this way
(We're walking, we're walking)
Last night's bubble gum,
No more bubbles, no more yum.
Where'd I get the wrist band?
Tell me there's no tramp stamp.
One, two, three, shoot,
No I know that shit ain't cute
But dammit, man, the show is fun
Party till the sun wakes up
Okay now raise your hands if
You've ever been guilty.
And clap, clap, clap, clap it out
If you'll walk with me.
Make the elevator come a little faster.
I'm pushing all the buttons
But nothing's happening
Please, God, don't let anybody see me
Please, God, I'll do anything you ask me
I promise no more walks of shame
So walk this way
(We're walking, we're walking)
Walk this way
(We're walking, we're walking)
I shouldn't have let you
Take my keys, take my keys
And left me here, too much beer
My friends, they hung me out too dry
It's not my fault... And that's why...
I'm doin' the walk of shame
Make the elevator come a little faster.
I'm pushing all the buttons
But nothing's happening
Please, God, don't let anybody see me
Please, God, I'll do anything you ask me
I promise no more walks of shame
So walk this way
(We're walking, we're walking)
Walk this way
(We're walking, we're walking)
So walk this way
(We're walking, we're walking)
Walk this way
(We're walking, we're walking)
