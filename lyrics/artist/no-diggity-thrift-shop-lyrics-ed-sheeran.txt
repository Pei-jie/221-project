Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz she don't play around
Cover much ground, cocaine by the pound
Gettin' paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her outta my mind (say what?!)
I think about the girl all the time (well, well)
East side to the west side
Push your fat rides ain't no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash quick when it comes to the gas
By no means average
It's obvious when she's got to have it
Baby you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Let me come in so I can win
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it, bag it up now
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it, bag it up now
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up
She's got class and style
And balance by the pound
Shorty never act wild
Very low key on the profile
Catching feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Curve's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You never quiet know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty bang-bang to look your way
I like the way you work it
Top notch, trump tight, everyday
You're blowing my mind, baby in time
Maybe I can get you in my ride
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it, bag it up now
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up now
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Damn that girl looks good
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Play on, play on, play on
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
Damn that girl looks good
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo
No, no
'Cause I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I- I- I'm hunting looking for a come-up
This is freaking awesome
Now, now I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I- I- I'm hunting looking for a come-up
This is freaking awesome
Now, now I'm gonna pop some tags (I like the way you work it)
No diggity, I got to bag it up (bag it up now)
I'm gonna pop some tags (I like the way you work it)
No diggity, I got to bag it up
Now I'm gonna pop some tags (I like the way you work it)
No diggity, I got to bag it up (bag it up now)
I'm gonna pop some tags (I like the way you work it)
No diggity, I got to bag it up
