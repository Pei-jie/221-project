i gotta find my way out of this hell, you got me into,
my baby's sleepin in anothers bed,
it's like i'm dreamin that walls are closing in on me,
i just wanna know you care.
i wanna find out why, you didnt choose to stay,baby,
you got me going crazy
ooo... my baby she got me oh no... she left me a prisoner inside my words, ooo...... my baby she got me oh no.. she locked me in prison like a criminal
everyday's the same, your word, lied away, when all you go and done isnt me, i can see you now, your long brown hair and your white wedding gown, baby im missing you...
i wanna find out why, you didnt choose to stay oh..., oh ya...,
ooo... my baby she got me oh no... she left me a prisoner inside my words, ooo... my baby she got me oh no.. she locked me in prison like a criminal
i can't stop this, all this daydreaming , i gotta do my time... i ooo... i can't get out, i don't wanna feel this way, save me from this misery...
i wanna find out why, you didnt choose to stay, baby..., you got me going crazy...
ooo... my baby she got me oh no... she left me a prisoner inside my words, ooo...... my baby she got me oh no.. she locked me in prison like a criminal
i promise to love ya, hold ya, even when time got hard and i can still see us being forever, but now we're falling apart...
i wanna find out why, you didnt choose to stay, baby... you got me, ooo... my baby she got me oh no... she left me a prisoner inside my words, ooo...... my baby she got me oh no.. she locked me in prison like a criminal
