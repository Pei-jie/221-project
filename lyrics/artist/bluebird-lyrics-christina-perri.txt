How the hell does a broken heart
Get back together when it's torn apart?
Teach itself to start beating again
Ba-ba-ba-ba
This little bluebird
Came looking for you
It said that I hadn't seen you
In quite some time
This little bluebird
She came looking again
I said we weren't even friends
She could have you
Don't you think it was hard?
I didn't even say that you died
But it wouldn't have been such a lie
'Cause then I started to cry
This little bluebird sure won't give it a rest
She swears that she may be better than all the rest
I said, no, you've got it all wrong
If he was something special I wouldn't have this song
And don't you think it was hard?
I didn't even say that you died
But it wouldn't have been such a lie
'Cause then I started to cry
How the hell does a broken heart
Get back together when it's torn apart?
And teach itself to start beating again
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba
What if when she comes over
I am in your arms?
Taking all I want from you again
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
How the hell does a broken heart
Get back together when it's torn apart?
Teach itself to start beating again
Ba-ba-ba-ba
How the hell does a broken heart
Get back together when it's torn apart?
Teach itself to start beating again
Ba-ba-ba-ba, beating again, ba-ba-ba-ba
This little bluebird
Don't come 'round here anymore
So I went looking for her
And I found you
