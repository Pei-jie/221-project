I've been working hard so long
seems like pain has been my only friend
my fragile heart's been done so wrong
I wondered if i'd ever heal again
ohh just like all the seasons never stay the same
all around me i can feel a change (ohh)
CHORUS
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
leave the past behind me, today my life begins
a whole new world is waiting it's mine for the taking
I know I can make it, today my life begins
Yesterday has come and gone
and I've learnt how to leave it where it is
and I see that I was wrong
for ever doubting i could win
Ohh just like all the seasons never stay the same
all around me i can feel a change (ohh)
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
leave the past behind me, today my life begins
a whole new world is waiting it's mine for the taking
I know I can make it, today my life begins
Life's too short to have regrets
so I'm learning now to leave it in the past and try to forget
only have one life to live
so you better make the best of it
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
leave the past behind me, today my life begins
a whole new world is waiting it's mine for the taking
I know I can make it, today my life begins
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
leave the past behind me, today my life begins
a whole new world is waiting it's mine for the takin
I know I can make it, today my life begins
today my life begins...
