rock
I've been all around the world, I've been a new sensation
But it doesn't really matter, in this g-generation
The sophmore slump is an uphill battle
And someone said that ain't my scene
'Cause they need a new song, like a new religion
Music for the television, I can't do the long division
Someone do the math
For the record label puts me on the shelf up in the freezer
Gotta find another way to live the life of leisure
So I drop my top, mix and a mingle
Is everybody ready for the single and it goes
Ha la la la la, l-listen closer to the verse I lay
Ha la la la la, it's all about the wordplay
Ha la la la love, the wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah the Mr. A to Z, they say I'm all about the wordplay
When it's time to get ill I got your remedy
For those who don't remember me
Well let me introduce you to my style
I try to keep a jumble in the lyrics, never mumble
When the music's makin' people tongue-tied
You want a new song, like a new religion
Music for the television, I can't do the long division
Someone do the math
For the people write me off like I'm a one-hit wonder
Gotta find another way to keep from goin' under
Pull out the stops, got your attention
I guess it's time again for me to mention, the wordplay
Ha la la la la, l-listen closer to the words I lay
Ha la la la la, it's all about the wordplay
Ha la la la love, the wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah the Mr. A to Z, they say I'm all about the wordplay
I built a bridge across the stream of consciousness
That always seems to be a flowin'
But I don't know which way my brain is goin'
Oh the rhymin' and the timin'
Keeps the melodies inside of me
And they're climbin' till I'm running out of air
Are you prepared to take a dive into the deep end of my head
Are you listening to a single word I've said?
Ah la la la la la la, listen closer to the words I say
Ah la la la la, I'm stickin' to the wordplay
Ah la la la love, the wonderful thing it does
Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's
Yeah the Mr. A to Z, they say I'm all about the wordplay
Ha la la la la, I'm all about the wordplay
Ha la la la la, I'm stickin' with the wordplay
Ha la la la love, I love the wonderful thing it does
Because, because
The ooh's and ah's and fa-la-la's are back in love
For the Mr. A to Z they say, is all about the wordplay
