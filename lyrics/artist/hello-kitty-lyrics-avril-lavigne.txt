Minna saiko, arigato, ka ka ka kawaii, ka ka ka kawaii
Mom's not home tonight
So we can roll around have a pillow fight
Like a major rager omfg
Let's all slumber party
Like a fat kid on a pack of smarties
Someone chuck a cupcake at me
It's time for spin the bottle
Not gonna talk about it tomorrow
Keep it just between you and me
Let's play truth or dare now
We can roll around in our underwear how
Every silly Kitty should be
Come Come
Kitty Kitty
You're so pretty pretty
Don't go Kitty Kitty
Stay with me
Come Come
Kitty Kitty
You're so silly silly
Don't go Kitty Kitty
Play with me
ka ka ka kawaii
Hello Kitty, Hello Kitty
Hello Kitty, you're so pretty
Hello Kitty, Hello Kitty
Hello Kitty, you're so silly
Wake up got a secret
Pinky swear that you're gonna keep it
I've got something you need to see
Let's be friends forever
I wanna do everything with you together
Come and play with Kitty and me
Come Come
Kitty Kitty
You're so pretty pretty
Don't go Kitty Kitty
Stay with me
Come Come
Kitty Kitty
You're so silly silly
Don't go Kitty Kitty
Play with me

Hello Kitty, Hello Kitty
Hello Kitty, you're so pretty
Hello Kitty, Hello Kitty
Hello Kitty, you're so silly

Mina saiko, arigato, ka ka ka kawaii
