Who knows how long?
I'd better wake now
The shadows on my wall don't sleep
They keep calling me
Beckoning
Who knows what's right?
The lies keep getting thinner
My age has never made me wise
But I keep pushing on and on and on and on
There's nothing left to say now oh oh
There's nothing left to say now oh oh
I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now
I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now
There's nothing left to say now oh oh
There's nothing left to say now oh oh
I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now
I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now
Below, my soul
I'm feelin' injured
Collapsing as it sees the pain
If I could only shut it down
I've come too far to see the end now
Giving if my way is long
But I keep pushing on and on and on and on
There's nothing left to say now oh oh
There's nothing left to say now oh oh
I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now
I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now
There's nothing left to say now oh oh
There's nothing left to say now oh oh
I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now
I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now
I keep fallin', I keep fallin' down
I keep fallin', I keep fallin' down
I keep fallin', I keep fallin' down
I keep fallin', I keep fallin' down
If you could only save
I'm drowning in the waters of myself
There's nothing left to say now oh oh
There's nothing left to say now oh oh
I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now
I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now
There's nothing left to say now oh oh
There's nothing left to say now oh oh
I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now
I'm giving up, giving up he he
Giving up now
Where do we go from here?
I threw some rocks up at your window
I broke some rocks right through your window
Timber timber, we're falling down
Let the forest hear us out
Bumba rumba rum awh awh
Bumba rumba rum awh awh
Why can't I see what's right in front of me
We fall, we falling
We fall, we falling
We fall, we falling
We fall, we falling
