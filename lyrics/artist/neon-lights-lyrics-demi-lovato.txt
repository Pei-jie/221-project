Baby when they look up at the sky
We'll be shooting stars just passing by
You'll be comming home with me tonight
We'll be burning up like neon lights
Be still my heart cause its freaking out
Its freaking out, right now
Shining like stars cause were beautiful
We're beautiful, right now
You're all I see in all these places
You're all I see in all these faces
So let's pretend we're running out of time, of time
Baby when they look up at the sky
We'll be shooting stars just passing by
You'll be coming home with me tonight
And we'll be burning up like neon lights
