Is what I got to be, is what I got to be
Is what I got to be, is what I got
Courage is the triumph of the soul
I know where I wanna walk, I know where I wanna go
Come put your hand in mine
Everybody's welcome
Music is what God wants us to do
Sing a song for me and I'll sing a song for you
When we put our voices together
We create a harmony
And we bring you some love, a love, a love
Love, a love, a love, love, a love, a love, love, love, love
Yeah, you can sing if you want to
It's love, a love, a love, love, a love, a love
Love, a love, a love, la-la-love
All I want to share with you is all my love
It's all I really care to do
Champion the idea of one love
All people the same, one beautiful race
Making a home of this beautiful place
And be grateful for the precious gifts of life
Sunshine and water, food from the greatest giver
Anything you want can be yours at anytime
Anything you want can be yours at anytime
It's love, a love, a love, love, a love, a love
Love, a love, a love, love, a love, a love
Sing out the world, sing out the world
It's love, a love, a love, love, a love, a love
Love, a love, a love, la-la-love
All I want to share with you is all my love
It's all I really care to do
'Cause anything you want can be yours at anytime
All I want to share with you is all my love
It's all I really care to do
Anything you want can be yours at anytime
Anything you want, anything you want
Anything you want
Anything you want can be yours at anytime
