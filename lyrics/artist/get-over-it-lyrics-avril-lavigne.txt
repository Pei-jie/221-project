Slipping down a slide, I did enjoy the ride
Don't know what to decide you lied to me
You looked me in the eye, it took me by surprise
Now are you gratified, you cried to me
La, la, la, la, la
Don't turn around, I'm sick
And I'm tired of your face
Don't make this worse
You've already gone and got me mad
It's too bad, I'm not sad
It's casting over
It's just one of those things
You'll have to get over it
When I was feeling down, you'd start to hang around
And then I found your hands all over me
And that was out of bounds you filthy rotten hound
It's badder than it sounds, believe me
La, la, la, la, la, la
Don't turn around, I'm sick
And I'm tired of your face
Don't make this worse
You've already gone and got me mad
It's too bad, I'm not sad
It's casting over
It's just one of those things
You'll have to get over it
Hey ya, you gotta get over
Hey ya, you gotta get over it
It's too bad, I'm not sad
It's casting over
It's just one of those things
You'll have to get over it
Don't turn around, I'm sick
And I'm tired of your face
Don't make this worse
You've already gone and got me mad
Don't turn around, I'm sick
And I'm tired of your face
Don't make this worse
You've already gone and got me mad
Too bad, I'm not sad
It's casting over
It's just one of those things
You'll have to get over it
You'll have to get over it
