Conversations with my 13 year old self
Conversations with my 13 year old self
You're angry, I know this
The world couldn't care less
You're lonely, I feel this
And you wish, you were the best
No teachers or guidance
And you always walk alone
You're crying at night when
Nobody else is home
Come over here and let me
Hold your hand and hug you, darlin'
I promise you that it won't
Always feel this bad
There are so many things
I want to say to you
You're the girl, I used to be
You little heartbroken 13 year old me
You're laughin' but you're hidin'
God, I know that trick too well
You forget that I've been you
And now I'm just the shell
I promise, I love you
And everything will work out fine
Don't try to grow up yet
Oh, just give it some time
The pain you feel is real
You're not asleep but it's a nightmare
But you can wake up anytime
Oh, don't lose your passion
Or the fighter that's inside of you
You're the girl, I used to be
The pissed off complicated 13 year old me
Conversations with my 13 year old self
Conversations with my 13 year old self
Until we meet again
Oh, I wish you well
Oh, I wish you well
Little girl
Until we meet again
Oh, I wish you well
Little girl
I wish you well
Until we meet again
My little 13 year old me
