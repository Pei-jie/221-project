So this is how it goes
Well I, I would have never known
And if it ends today
Well I'll still say that you shine brighter than anyone
Now I think we're taking this too far
Don't you know that it's not this hard?
Well, it's not this hard
But if you take what's your's and I take mine
Must we go there?
Please, not this time, no, not this time
Well this is not your fault
But if I'm without you then I will feel so small
And if you have to go
We'll always know that you shine brighter than anyone does
Now I think we're taking this too far
Don't you know that it's not this hard?
Well, it's not this hard
But if you take what's your's and I take mine
Must we go there?
Please, not this time, no, not this time
If you run away now
Will you come back around?
And if you ran away
I'd still wave goodbye
Watching you shine bright
Now I think we're taking this too far
Don't you know that it's not this hard?
Well, it's not this hard
But if you take what's your's and I take mine
Must we go there?
Please, not this time, no, not this time
I'll wave goodbye
Watching you shine bright
(You shine bright, you shine bright)
I'll wave goodbye tonight
