Pink
pop
You used to hold the door for me
Now you can't wait to leave
You used to send me flowers
If you fucked up in my dreams
I used to make you laugh
With all the silly shit I did
But now you roll your eyes
And walk away and shake your head
When the spark has gone and the candles are out
And the song is done and there's no more sound
Whispers turn to yelling and I'm thinking
How did we get so mean?
How do we just move on?
How do you feel in the morning
When it comes and everything's undone?
Is it 'cause we wanna be free?
Well that's not me
Normally I'm so strong
I just can't wake up on the floor
Like a thousand times before
Knowing that forever won't be
Always sentimental when
I think of how it was
When love was sweet and new
And we just couldn't get enough
The shower it reminds me
You'd undress me with your eyes
And now you never touch me
And you tell me that you're tired
You know I get so sad when it all goes bad
And all you think about is all the fun you had
And all those sorries ain't never gonna mean a thing, oh
How did we get so mean?
How do we just move on?
How do you feel in the morning
When it comes and everything's undone?
Is it 'cause we wanna be free?
Well that's not me
Normally I'm so strong
I just can't wake up on the floor
Like a thousand times before
Knowing that forever won't be
We said some things that we can never take back
It's like a train wreck tryna hit the right track
We opened up the wine and we just let it breathe
But we shoulda drank it down while it was still sweet
It all goes bad eventually
Now do we stay together
'Cause we're scared to be alone?
We got so used to this abuse
It kind of feels like home
But my baby, I just really wanna know
How did we get so mean?
How do we just move on?
How do you feel in the morning
When it comes and everything's undone?
Is it 'cause we wanna be free?
Well that's not me
Normally I'm so strong
I just can't wake up on the floor
Like a thousand times before
Knowing that forever won't be
How do we just move on?
How do you feel in the morning
When it comes and everything's undone?
Is it 'cause we wanna be free?
Well that's not me
Normally I'm so strong
I just can't wake up on the floor
Like a thousand times before
Knowing that forever won't be
