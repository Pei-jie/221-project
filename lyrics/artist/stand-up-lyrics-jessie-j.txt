If you surround yourself with negative people
You'll never feel settled in or become an equal, no
They'll suppress you of your spirit and rinse you dry of smiles
So reach deep and release your inner child, yeah, yeah
So stand up for the love, love, love
So stand up for the love, love, love
So stand up for the love, love, love
So stand up, stand up, for the love, love
'Cause you're as old as you feel you are
And if you don't reach for the moon you can't fall on the stars
So I live my life like every day is the last, last, last
'Cause you're as old as you feel you are
And if you don't reach for the moon you can't fall on the stars
So I live my life like every day is the last, last, last
So stand up
If you let a frown become your normality, yes
You don't set an example for the youth of our humanity
If you spend every day wishing for the next to come
Aged and lifeless is what, yes, you'll become, yeah, yeah
So stand up for the love, love, love
So stand up for the love, love, love
So stand up for the love, love, love
So stand up, stand up, for the love, love
'Cause you're as old as you feel you are

'Cause you're as old as you feel you are
And if you don't reach for the moon you can't fall on the stars
So I live my life like every day is the last, last, last
(So stand up)

So ignore the bad and the good will soon come
Don't think second best, be number one
Spread some love, don't give to receive
Strive to be happy and live to believe
