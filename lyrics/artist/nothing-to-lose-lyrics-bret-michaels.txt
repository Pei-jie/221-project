She looks in the mirror
But the make-up it don't hide the pain
Yeah, she swore that the last time
Was the last time she'd fall again, fall again
So close your eyes
Just fall tonight
She says, "Let this be alright
Alright, alright, alright"
Won't you fall down on me?
So close I can feel you breathe
Tonight in the darkness
With nothing to lose
If the truth is all we can see
If I fall for you
Could you fall for me?
Could you fall for me?
I've been torn up, broke down
Wearing my heart on my sleeve
Yeah, the scars that you wear
Well, I got them too
Can't you see?
Can't you see?
Yeah, we're both better than this
(Better than this)
Still we can't resist
(Still we can't resist)
Slowly get undressed
Yeah, she does
Won't you fall down on me?
So close I can feel you breathe
Tonight in the darkness
With nothing to lose
If the truth is all we could see
If I fall for you
Could you fall for me?
Won't you fall down on me?
(On me)
So close I can feel you breathe
(Feel you breathe)
Tonight in the darkness
With nothing to lose
If the truth is all we could see
If I fall for you
Could you for me?
Won't you feel down on me?
So close I can feel you breathe
(Feel you breathe)
Tonight in the darkness
With nothing to lose
If the truth is all we could see
If I fall for you
Could you for me?
Could you for me?
