pop
The tramps and thieves are ready
For steal the broken hearts
In the middle of the night
Waiting into the crossroad
With holy water in their hands
Waiting for the white dress girl
With the blood in her eyes
Standing in front of a curch
Trying keep her down low
The victim of devil are ready
To make her own exorcism
Fix a cruz at your heart
Put a light in your soul
Her daddy should know (oh-oh)
Her mom keep head down
Waiting for the day's light for the end of exorcism apart
Waiting for devil leave's her soul
Waiting for her lover dry her own tears
Waiting for the day to skip the exorcism
