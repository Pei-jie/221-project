Boy, you get me so high
I'm buzzin' like a bee hive
It's just a little kiss, but when it hits my lips, I'm sippin' on sunshine
Boy you lookin' so fly
Hotter than July
Now I just wanna stay, forever and a day, sippin' on sunshine
Down at the beach, you're holdin' my hand
Got an umbrella stuck in the sand
Watchin' the waves crash into the shore
Baby I want some more
Hey! (Hey!) What a beautiful day! (Day!)
All I need is a taste (Hey!)
Nothin' but a good time, sippin' on sunshine!
Ho! (Ho!) Don't got nowhere to go! (Go!)
So we'll go with the flow! (Flow!)
Yeah, were livin' the life, sippin' on sunshine!
Hey!
Ho!
Hey!
Sippin' on sunshine!
Boy you blow my mind, you got me up on cloud 9
Just a little taste, I wouldn't wanna waste a sip of that sunshine
We can kick it all night, underneath the moonlight
But when the party ends, we'll do it all again, sippin' on sunshine
Down at the beach, you're holdin' my hand
Got an umbrella stuck in the sand
Watchin' the waves crash into the shore
Baby I want some more
Hey! (Hey!) What a beautiful day! (Day!)
All I need is a taste (Hey!)
Nothin' but a good time, sippin' on sunshine!
Ho! (Ho!) Don't got nowhere to go! (Go!)
So we'll go with the flow! (Flow!)
Yeah, were livin' the life, sippin' on sunshine!
Hey! (Ho!)
Sippin' on sunshine!
Hey!
Sippin' on sunshine!
Sippin' on sunshine!
Sippin' on sunshine!
Sunshine (x12)
Hey! (Hey!) What a beautiful day! (Day!)
All I need is a taste (Hey!)
Nothin' but a good time, sippin' on sunshine!
Ho! (Ho!) Don't got nowhere to go! (No we don't!)
So we'll go with the flow! (Hell yeah!)
Yeah, were livin' the life (The life!), sippin' on sunshine!
All day, all night!
(Sippin' on sunshine!)
Yeah! Good times! Everybody's just sippin on sunshine!
Woah, Woah
Woah, Ho
Sippin' on sunshine!
