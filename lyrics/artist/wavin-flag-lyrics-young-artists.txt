When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
Born from a throne, older than Rome
But violent prone, poor people zone
But it's my home, all I have known
Where I got grown but now it's gone
Out of the darkness, in came the carnage
Threatening my very survival
Fractured my streets and broke all my dreams
Feels like defeat to wretched retreat
So we strugglin', fighting to eat
And we wonderin' if we'll be free
We cannot wait for some faithful day
It's too far away so right I'll say
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a waving flag
And then it goes back and then it goes back
And then it goes back, aho, aho, aho
So many wars, settling scores
All that we've been through and now there is more
I hear them say love is the way
Love is the answer, that's what they say
But we're not just dreamers of broken down grievers
Our hand will reach us and we will not see ya
This can't control us, no it can't hold us down
We gonna pick it up even though we still struggling
Au nom de la survie
(In the name of survival)
And we wondering
Battant pour nos vie
(Fighting for our lives)
We patiently wait for some other day
That's too far away so right now we say
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a waving flag
And then it goes back and then it goes back
And then it goes back, aho, aho, aho
Uh, well, alright, how come when the media stops covering
And there's a little help from the government
We forget about the people still struggling
And assume that it's really all love again? Nah
See, we don't have to wait for things to break apart
If you weren't involved before it's never too late to start
You probably think that it's too far to even have to care
Well, take a look at where you live, what if it happened there?
You have to know the urge to make a change lies within
And we can be the reason that we see the flag rise again
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back and then it goes back
Then it goes back
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a waving flag
And then it goes back and then it goes back
And then it goes back, aho, aho, aho
When I get older, when I get older
I will be stronger just like a waving flag
