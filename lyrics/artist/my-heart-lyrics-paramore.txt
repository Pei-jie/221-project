Paramore
rock
I am finding out that maybe I was wrong
That I've fallen down and I can't do this alone
Stay with me, this is what I need, please?
Sing us a song and we'll sing it back to you
We could sing our own
But what would it be without you?
I am nothing now and it's been so long
Since I've heard the sound, the sound of my only hope
This time I will be listening
Sing us a song and we'll sing it back to you
We could sing our own
But what would it be without you?
This heart, it beats, beats for only you
This heart, it beats, beats for only you
This heart, it beats, beats for only you
My heart is your's
This heart, it beats, beats for only you
My heart is your's
This heart, it beats, beats for only you
My heart is your's
This heart, it beats, beats for only you
My heart, my heart is your's
My heart is your's
My heart is your's
My heart is
