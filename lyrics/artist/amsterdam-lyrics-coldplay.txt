Come on, oh, my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
And if I, if I'd only waited
I'd not be stuck here in this hole
Come here, oh, my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
And I swear I waited and waited
I've got to get out of this hole
But time is on your side, it's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
It's no cause for concern
Come on, oh, my star is fading
And I see no chance of release
And I know I'm dead on the surface
But I'm screaming underneath
And time is on your side, it's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
Oh, it's no cause for concern
Stuck on the end of this ball and chain
I'm on my way back down again
Stood on the edge, tied to the noose
Sick to the stomach
Say what you mean
But it won't change a thing
I'm sick of our secrets
Stood on the edge, tied to the noose
And you came along and you cut me loose
You came along and you cut me loose
You came along and you cut me loose
