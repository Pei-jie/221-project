You are natural sweet not just beautiful
Cause you follow your heart
It makes even more special that you don't know how damn lovely you are
I would kiss a mirror every single day
If I wake up with your face
What are all these doubts for spinning in your head
Don't you look so sad
Won't you come right here
Set the mind off you
Nobody nobody nobody's perfect but you yeah
You mean the world to me
I cant believe youre true
Cause nobody nobody nobodys perfect but you
[beat break]
Nobody nobody, nobody nobody
Nobody nobody, nobody nobody
Nobody nobody, nobodys perfect but you
When you stand close to me I get paralyzed
I forget how to breath
Every place is forsaken and feels so wrong
Every time that you leave
You catch me when im falling
You bring me back to life
When im dying you rise
Now, what are all these doubts for spinning in your head
Don't you look so sad
Won't you come right here
Set the mind off you
Nobody nobody nobody's perfect but you yeah
You mean the world to me
I cant believe youre true
Cause nobody nobody nobodys perfect but you
[beat break]
Nobody nobody, nobody nobody
Nobody nobody, nobody nobody
Nobody nobody, nobodys perfect but you
Yeah You mean the world to me
Nobody nobody, nobodys perfect but you
Won't you come right here
Set the mind off you
Nobody nobody nobody's perfect but you yeah
You mean the world to me
I cant believe youre true
Cause nobody nobody nobodys perfect but you
