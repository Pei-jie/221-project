Pink
pop
I keep thinkin' bout that little sparkle in your eye
Is it a light from the Angels or you're Devil deep inside?
What about the way you say you love me all the time?
Are you liftin' me up to Heaven just to drop me down the line?
There's a ring around my finger
But will you change your mind?
And you tell me that I'm beautiful
But that could be a lie
Are you a heartbreaker?
Maybe you want me for the ride
What if I'm fallin' for a heartbreaker?
And everything is just a lie
I won't be leavin' here alive
And l won't be leavin' here alive, no
Temporary happiness is like waiting for the knife
'Cause I'm always watchin' for someone to show the darker side
So maybe I'll sit back and just enjoy all this for now
Watch it all play out, see if you really stick around
But there's always this one question
That keeps me up at night
Are you my greatest love
Or disappointment in my life?
Are you a heartbreaker?
Maybe you want me for the ride
What if I'm fallin' for a heartbreaker?
And everything is just a lie
I won't be livin' here alive
I might as well lay down and die
I'm holding on with both hands
And both feet, oh
Promise that you won't pull the rug
Out from under me
Are you a heartbreaker?
Maybe you want me for the ride
I pray to God you're not a heartbreaker
This time around I won't survive
'Cause if I'm fallin' for a heartbreaker
And everything is just a lie
And I won't be livin' here alive
And I might as well lay down and die, oh
I won't be livin' here alive
