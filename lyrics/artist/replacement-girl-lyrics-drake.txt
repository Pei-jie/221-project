Drake
hiphop
[Trey Songz echoing]
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement...
[VERSE 1]
Let me show you what it is,
I was birthed up top,
I was raised at the bottom of the map,
Where the girls all thick,
And the hottest nigga rap ,
And if you lookin for the good and we got 'em,
In the trap like (ooh wee),
took 'em from white sneaks to (looeee),
This metaphor might sound a lil confusing but (ya'll already knoow if you know me),
I done come a long way from the days inn,
Another hotel that i stayed in,
I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good,
And now we see it's sitting at amazing,
Girls trying to ho lobby us,
Hear 'em all screaming and it's prolly us,
But i can't blame females,
Females can't really ignore something this obvious,
What you really expect when i strut through town,
Two or three days and i'll shut you down,
Chillin with the homie trey songz,
You call him the prince,
He rep two up, two down,
Anyone i know get used to me,
I'm far the man that i used to be,
And i don't ever really kick game,
And i know you find it impressing when you're introduced to me,
Cause imma good dude, take pride in that,
Need good loving i'm providing that,
Understand that i'm worldwide,
You get it how you want it wherever you be residing at,
Cause i do things from the M town to the UK from Spain back out to Texas,
This album for my fans but yo this hook is for my exes.
[CHORUS]
This one is for you girl,
You know who you are girl,
You only show your face,
Cuz you know that Im a star girl,
But ur trynna make it,
Dont ever mistake it,
Girl my time is limited,
And I aint trynna waste it (all on you),
You had your chance now its gone (so long for you),
You had a man now you dont (now you dont),
Back to da basics,
I think i made it,
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl.
[VERSE 2]
Aint you ever seen a youngin so fly,
Lookin for something yo type,
I been left behind the love of my life,
Trying to find another one tonight,
And if its you baby,
Let yourself be seen (dont mind the skirts),
Dresses and jeans (i got the work,
Know what I mean,
And I'm flexing on my ex,
If you know what I mean,
[CHORUS]
This one is for you girl,
You know who you are girl,
You only show your face,
Cuz you know that Im a star girl,
But ur trynna make it,
Dont ever mistake it,
Girl my time is limited,
And I aint trynna waste it (all on you),
You had your chance now its gone (so long for you),
You had a man now you dont (now you dont),
Back to da basics,
I think i made it,
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl.
[VERSE 3]
Wit' dem otha dudes she get picked up, for some take out
Till dey slip up, and then dey break out
But it's anotha story ova here at Drakes house
Cuz I'm dripped up, and I'm draped out
And I'm leaned back, scopin
looking for a woman that i should wife
Who got just a right amount of loyalty in her
But still anticipatin us livin' the good life
We go LA, VA, NY, TO, sunshine,
And that heat stroke, and them fur hoods, and that deep snow,
We have breakfast in da bedroom,
Or break bread downstairs in the basement,
Since Jay & Kelz aint doing they thang no more,
Guess me and the boy Songz the replacement.
[CHORUS]
This one is for you girl,
You know who you are girl,
You only show your face,
Cuz you know that Im a star girl,
But ur trynna make it,
Dont ever mistake it,
Girl my time is limited,
And I aint trynna waste it (all on you),
You had your chance now its gone (so long for you),
You had a man now you dont (now you dont),
Back to da basics,
I think i made it,
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl.
[Beat fades out]
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Let's go.
