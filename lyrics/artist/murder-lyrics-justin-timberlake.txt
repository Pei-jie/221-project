[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Walking around middle of the night
Right in the man's life with that innocent face
Cause everything below your neck killin' everything next
It's murder, murder
You say I need to watch out something might go down good I really wanna take this
under the ground, under the ground
And I will be down and throw it at that level
And even when you speak regular it's sick freak girl, I say ok so come on and leave me cause the deeper you take me the better better
You killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to beds way under the ground, under the ground
And I will be down and throw it at that level
[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
Ooooh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
Ooooh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
under the lights and sound
Everybody get down, down
You know that she's a killer
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Murder....
[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
You dancing around, hanging out the window
Talking real big with your little slim waist
And with all that below your waist
Girl, you know the next scene is murder
Maybe you need to watch out something might go down girl your body is gonna end up
Under the ground, under the ground
I will be down and throw it at that level
And even when you dress regular a freak chic
Girl you complement my taste
So girl don't be stenchy the more that you give me the better better
You know you killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to til the beds
way under the ground, under the ground
And I will be down and throw it at that level
[Hook]
Ooooh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
Ooooh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
Under the lights and sound
Everybody get down, down
You know that she's a killer
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Murder....
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Yoko Ono, she got that Yoko Ono
You know that shit that made John Lennon go solo
Know that shit gotta be lethal
If that pussy broke up The Beatles
Chocha ruined pop culture
All them playa days is over
Got me buying Rovers, rings
Jumping over brooms and church rooms, kaboom
That bomb, that P, it's a problem called the police
Red bottoms, white sheets that's murder, she a beast
Faces of death, she fine or what
Suicide I'm trying to cut, white chalk line 'em up
Give new meaning to dying to fuck
[Hook] X2
Ooooh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
Ooooh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
Under the lights and sound
Everybody get down, down
You know that she's a killer
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Murder....
I line em up
She shoot em down

Watch it get watch it get down

Hook
Ooooh that girl is murder
Everybody get down
Ooooh that girl is murder

Under the lights and sound
Everybody get down, down

Watch it get down, watch it get down
