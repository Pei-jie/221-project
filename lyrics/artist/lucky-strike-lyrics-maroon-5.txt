Youre such a motivator, got to get your way
So sick of saying yes sir, yes sir
Youre such an instigator; you wanna play the game
Take it or leave it, thats her, thats her
And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
Your body rockin, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike
Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me (yeah)
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
Whooooa, oh oh oh
My lucky strike
Whooooa, oh oh oh
My lucky strike
Whooooa, oh oh oh
Your body rockin, keep me up all night
Whooooa
One in a million, my lucky strike
Stuck in her elevator
She takes me to the sky
And I don't wanna go down, go down
She said Ill feel you later; go ahead and fantasize
She makes me want it right now, right now
And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
Your body rockin, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike.
Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me (yeah)
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
Whooooa, oh oh oh
My lucky strike
Whooooa, oh oh oh
My lucky strike
Whooooa, oh oh oh
Your body rockin, keep me up all night
Whooooa
One in a million, my lucky strike
Hey, youre takin all my pain away
Youre shakin like an earthquake
Hey, youre takin all my pain away
Youre shakin like an earthquake
Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me (yeah)
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
Whooooa, oh oh oh
My lucky strike
Whooooa, oh oh oh
My lucky strike
Whooooa, oh oh oh
Your body rockin, keep me up all night
Whooooa
One in a million, my lucky strike
