Every time
Every time
Every time we touch
I feel it
I feel it
Every time we touch
Emotions that I cant contain
Sweepin over me again
Every time we touch
Sensations I can not explain
Washin all away my pain
Every time we touch
Magic sprinkled deep inside
Sending me the breath of life
Every time we touch (yeah)
Something takes a hold of me
Every time we touch
Every time we touch
Heaven and earth collide
Everything feels so right
Every time we touch
This feeling takes over me
Something takes hold of me
Every time we touch (yeah)
Heaven and earth collide
Everything feels so right
Every time we touch
This feeling takes over me
Something takes hold of me
Every time we touch
Ohhh Yeah
Every time youre near me
Ohhh
And I feel so good, inside
Yeah Yeahhh Yeah
Every time we touch
The secrets of my beating heart
Breaking free out of the dark
Every time we touch (yeah)
All the things I cant express
Fill me up with such happiness
Every time we touch
(?)All the changes that had my heart
Broken all to the ground (?)
Every time we touch
Something takes a hold of me
Every time we touch
Every time we touch
Heaven and earth collide
Everything feels so right
Every time we touch
This feeling takes over me
Something takes hold of me
Every time we touch (yeah)
Heaven and earth collide
