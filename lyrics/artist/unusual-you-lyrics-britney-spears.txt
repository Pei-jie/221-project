Nothing about you is typical
Nothing about you is predictable
You got me all twisted and confused
It's so you
Up 'til now I thought I knew love
Nothing to lose and it's damaged cause
Patterns will fall as quick as I do
But now
Bridges are burning, baby, I'm learnin'
A new way of thinking now
Love, I can see, nothing will be, just like it was
Is that because
Baby, you're so unusual
Didn't anyone tell you, you're supposed to
Break my heart, I expect you to, so why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human 'cause
Only an angel could be so unusual
Sweet surprise, I could get used to unusual you
Been so many things, when I was someone else
Boxer in the ring, tryin' to defend myself
And the private eyes to see what's goin' on
That's long gone
When I'm with you, I can just be myself
You're always where you say you will be
Shocking 'cause I never knew love like this could exist
Tables are turnin', my heart is soarin'
You'll never let me down
Answer the call, here after all
Never met anyone like you
Baby, you're so unusual
Didn't anyone tell you, you're supposed to
Break my heart, I expect you to, so why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human 'cause
Only an angel could be so unusual
Sweet surprise, I could get used to unusual you
I can't believe that I almost didn't try
When you called my name
Now everything has changed
Baby, you're so unusual
Didn't anyone tell you, you're supposed to
Break my heart, I expect you to, so why haven't you?
Maybe you're not even human 'cause
Only an angel could be so unusual
Sweet surprise, I could get used to unusual you
