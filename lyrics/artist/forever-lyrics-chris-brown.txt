Hey! Hey!
Forever
Hey! Hey!
Forever
It's you and me
Moving at the speed of light into eternity
Tonight is the night
To join me in the middle of ecstasy
Feel the melody and the rhythm of the music
Around you, around you
I'ma take you there, I'ma take you there
So don't be scared, I'm right here, ready?
We can go anywhere, go anywhere
But first, it's your chance, take my hand, come with me
It's like I waited my whole life for this one night
It's gon' be me, you and the dance floor
'Cause we only got one night
Double your pleasure, double your fun
And dance forever-ever-ever
Forever-ever-ever
Forever-ever-ever
Forever
(Forever)
Ever-ever-ever
Forever-ever-ever
Forever-ever-ever
Forever on the dance floor
Feels like were on another level
Feels like our love's intertwined
We can be two rebels
Breaking the rules, me and you, you and I
All you gotta do is watch me
Look what I can do with my feet
Baby, feel the beat inside
I'm driving, you could take the front seat
Just need you to trust me, oh oh oh
It's like now
It's like I waited my whole life for this one night
It's gon' be me, you and the dance floor
'Cause we only got one night
Double your pleasure, double your fun
And dance forever-ever-ever
Forever-ever-ever
Forever-ever-ever
Forever
(Forever)
Forever-ever-ever
Forever-ever-ever
Forever-ever-ever
Forever on the dance floor
It's a long way down, we so high off the ground
Sending for an angel to bring me your heart
Girl, where did you come from? Got me so undone
Gaze in your eyes got me saying
What a beautiful lady, no ifs, ands or maybes
I'm releasing my heart and it's feeling amazing
There's no one else that matters, you love me
And I won't let you fall girl, let you fall girl
I won't let you fall, let you fall, let you fall
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
It's like I waited my whole life for this one night
It's gon' be me you and the dance floor
'Cause we only got one night
Double your pleasure, double your fun
And dance forever-ever-ever
Forever-ever-ever
Forever-ever-ever
Forever
(Forever)
Forever-ever-ever
Forever-ever-ever
Forever-ever-ever
Forever on the dance floor
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh yeah
Forever-ever-ever-ever
Forever-ever oh
