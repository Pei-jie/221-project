You pull my strings, and push my soul
You fool my heart with every note
You drop a beat, and kiss my face
You make me move, then cut the base
And you work so hard to get me, just to let me go
Yeah you put me in the spotlight, just to steal the show
And you try to take me home like youre DiMaggio, oh
Its such a joke
Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song, what good is a love song without the love?
Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song, what good is a love song without the love?
Why are we acting like lovers? We dont know each other
Even though we used to rule the world
Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song, a love song without the love?
You so confused, its getting old
You wear your ring, but leave me cold
Youre beautiful, but cause me pain
You play my heart like its a game
And you work so hard to get me, just to let me go
Yeah you put me in the spotlight, just to steal the show
And you try to take me home like youre DiMaggio, oh
Its criminal
Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song, what good is a love song without the love?
Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song, what good is a love song without the love?
Why are we acting like lovers? We dont know each other
Even though we used to rule the world
Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song, a love song without the love?
This is the bend before the break
When we forget the harmony
This is how watercolors fade into distant memories
Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song, what good is a love song without the love?
Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song, what good is a love song without the love?
Why are we acting like lovers? We dont know each other
Even though we used to rule the world
Why are you singing me love songs?
What good is a love song, a love song without the love?
Without the love, without the love
