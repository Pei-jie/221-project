Wait a minute, I don't want you to know
It's the only way that I might grow
A secret's safe behind a pretty smile
And it's mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
What's with all the late night liquored phone calls?
I don't think your lover likes me at all
A secret's safe behind a pretty smile
But it's mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
What, what might you do
To find out why I can't love you?
I can't love you
And who said it was cool to be asking me these questions?
Your who, what and when, where and why are making my head spin
And when was it an option
To put your lips upon my lips?
And how did this happen
And why are you laughing
And how do I get back together again?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
What, what might you do?
And what, what might you do
To find out why, to find out why I can't love you?
I can't love you, I can't love you
