Cool me down,
I'm feeling so exotic
Yaa right now..
I'm hotter than the tropics
Take me down (Mr. Worldwide)
Mumbai Cuba baby let's go (Priyanka)
La-love me all the way o Rio

I'm feeling so exotic
Tumko jo dekha maine
Toh maine ye jaan liya hai
Pardesi babu ne
Iss desi dil ko maan liya hai (x2)
I'm like Bon Jovi..
In music game i'm more of a dead than alive
But that's okay, i live with it
That's why I live everyday like my last

From Morocco to Mumbai
Bollywood, Hollywood is all about the money
