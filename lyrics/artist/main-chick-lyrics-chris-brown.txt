I don't know your name,
But you hurt my name
I know why you came
Tryna get that name
But you hurt my name
Girl, I know you wanna be my main chick
My main chick
I say fuck whoever you came with
Who you came with!
I tell her fuck that nigger!
[Kid ink:]
Sitting in the back of the club,
Table got a rope in the front
I don't know ya, you looking real familiar
Or I could just be a little drunk
But I don't know your name, it's a god damn shame
I don't know how to explain it to you, but
Girl I'm just saying if you got a minute come back here
I don't know - what?
Keep it on the hush
Pocket full of treats, don't be around the bush
Wait, walk on green I can even hit the pot
Kate o shut it when I hit it with the punch lines
Hit a couple shots when it's kush time
Looking for my ex like a one time
Throw a sing when you really tryna go
Got the car parked right at the door!
I don't know your name,
But you hurt my name
I know why you came
Tryna get that name
But you hurt my name
Girl, I know you wanna be my main chick
My main chick
I say fuck whoever you came with
Who you came with!
I tell her fuck that nigger!
[Kid ink:]
No, you don't know my name
Just in case should've?
I might've poured you a drink
But don't let it go to your head
I know why you came, tryna be my main chick
Passed to decide when my lane switched
Talk back two seats only,
No room for your friends, I don't know 'em
We just seize in the moment,
Up all night, ? til the morning
Fly motherfucker, everything is important
Don't tryna act too important, I know your game
You got a gang nigger
All over you, but you're all over him
Girl, I ain't tryna gag it
Bad bitch surely thing, I caught you!
I don't know your name,
But you hurt my name
I know why you came
Tryna get that name
But you hurt my name
Girl, I know you wanna be my main chick
My main chick
I say fuck whoever you came with
Who you came with!
I tell her fuck that nigger!
Girl, why you playin?
You hurt my name,
I know why you came
You gonna gimme that brain
So we can do our thing
Let's do that thing
Would you think about me takin' you down here?
I can be your man when he's not 'round here!
I don't know your name,
But you hurt my name
I know why you came
Tryna get that name
But you hurt my name
Girl, I know you wanna be my main chick
My main chick
I say fuck whoever you came with
Who you came with!
I tell her fuck that nigger!
