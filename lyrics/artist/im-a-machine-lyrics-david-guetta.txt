Verse 1:
I got a feeling that you bout to get it
Cuz baby I'm killing this dress, boy get with it
Tonight I ain't playing no more
Boy I'm staying over
If you're ready babe, let me know
But don't you wrap me up babe if you ain't ready to go
Don't be ticking on my bomb if you ain't bout to blow
I'm all in it like I'm playing cards you all know
So let's go
Chorus:
Cuz I'm a machine baby
And you got the keys baby
I'm a machine baby
And I'm unstoppable (2x)
I want your body baby
I want your body baby
I wanna tear it apart and rebuild it baby (2x)
Verse 2:
I'm like an engine baby boy I'm running
And you got a target on your body I'm gunning
Cuz I got a weapon right here
Ain't no guessing round here
Cuz I'm leathal baby, oh
So don't you touch me right there if you ain't ready to rock
Boy I'm counting on you to hold me like a hands on a clock
Want you loving me harder than this beat, make it rock
So let's go
Chorus:
Cuz I'm a machine baby
And you got the keys baby
I'm a machine baby
And I'm unstoppable (2x)
I want your body baby
I want your body baby
I wanna tear it apart and rebuild it baby (4x)
Chorus:
Cuz I'm a machine baby
And you got the keys baby
I'm a machine baby
And I'm unstoppable
And I'll take you where you wanna go
