This is a story that I have never told
I gotta get this off my chest to let it go
I need to take back the light inside you stole
You're a criminal
And you steal like your a pro
All the pain and the truth
I wear like a battle wound
So ashamed, so confused
I was broken, and bruised
And now I'm a warrior
Now I've got thicker skin
I'm a warrior
I'm stronger than I've ever been
And my armor, is made of steel, you can't get in
I'm a warrior
And you can never hurt me again
Out of the ashes, I'm burning like a fire
You can save your apologies; you're nothing but a liar
I've got shame, 'Ive got scars
That I will never show
I'm a survivor
In more ways than you know
'Cuz all the pain and the truth
I wear like a battle wound
So ashamed so confused, I'm not broken, or bruised
Cuz now I'm a warrior
Now I got thicker skin
I'm a warrior
I'm stronger than I've ever been
And my armor, is made of steel, you can't get in
I'm a warrior
And you can never hurt me..
There is a part of me I can't get back
A little girl grew up too fast
All it took was once; I'll never be the same
Now I'm taking it back my life today
Nothing left that you can say
Cause you were never gonna take the blame anyway
Now I'm a warrior
I've got thicker skin
I'm a warrior
I'm stronger than Ive ever been
And my armor, is made of steel, you can't get in
I'm a warrior
And you can never hurt me again
Nooooo oooh yeaah yeaah
You can never hurt me again
