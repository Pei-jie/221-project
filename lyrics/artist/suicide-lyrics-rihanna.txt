Everywhere is still
everything is restless in my heart
I hate the way this feels
suddenly I'm scared to be apart.
The days are dark when you're not around
the air is getting hard to breathe.
I wish that you would just put me down
I wish that I could go to sleep.
Loving you is suicide
I don't know should go or should I stay.
I'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late.
But I heard you say you love me.
That's the part I can't forget
and I wish that you come save me
cause' I'm standing over the edge.
I should let you go
tell myself the things I need to hear
but my brain is wired wrong.
That's why i'm loving you when you're not here.
Feels like I drown in your every word
and every breath that's in between.
Somehow you got me where it really hurts
it's killing every part of me.
Loving you is suicide.
I don't know should go or should I stay.
I'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late.
But I heard you say you love me
that's the part I can't forget.
And I wish that you come save me
boy cause I'm standing over the edge..
loving you is suicide
and my world's about to break
and I had as much as I can take
and love is a long way down.
Loving you is suicide
and it's getting harder everyday.
I'm tryna to keep myself alive
knowing there's a chance it's all too late.
And I'm way past every moment
but I'm still determined to fight
and I know it's taking all my strength
to give emotions alive.
Loving you is suicide
