I'm wishing on a star
to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows
that I see
I wish on all the people who
really dream
And i'm wish on tomorrow
pray it never comes
I'm wishing on the love the things
we never done
I never thought i'd see
a time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me
Just think of all the moment
that we'd spend
I just can't let you go for me
you were meant
And I didn't mean to hurt you
but I know
In the game of love you reap
what you sow
I feel this time we should make up, baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh baby when we're together
Whether or never
I'm wishing on a star
to follow where you are
I'm wishing on a dream
to follow what it means
And I wish on all the rainbows
that I see
I wish on all the people who
really dream
And i'm wish on tomorrow
pray it never comes
I'm wishing on the love the things
we never done

Wishing on a star (oh, wishing on a star)
to follow where you are (oh any where you go)
Wishing on a star (i'm wishing on a star)
to follow where you are (to anywhere you go)
Wishing on a star
