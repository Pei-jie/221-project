Oh babe !...
I don't wanna lie
I'm gonna take what you're giving
'Cause I know you're willing
To take me all the way
You got me right here
Combustible
And I can't wait to finally explode
The big big bang
The reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide
In this beautiful design
The big big bang
The big big bang , the big big bang
Some people like to talk
But I'm into doing
What I feel like doing
When I'm inspired
So, if we take a walk down
The beach tonight
I bet that we could light up the sky
The big big bang
The reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide
In this universe inside
The big big bang
The big big bang, the big big bang
Take it from me, I don't wanna be
Mummified
Sometimes I feel so isolated
I wanna die
And I'll take it from me if you got it
Every time
So baby, bring your body here
Next to mine, next to mine
I don't wanna dream
I just wanna live it
So baby
Let's not miss this thing
The big big bang
The reason I'm alive
When all the stars collide
In this universe inside
The big big bang
The big big bang, the big big bang
Hit me big, big, big, bang
Whoa, baby
Whoa, baby
Whoa, baby
