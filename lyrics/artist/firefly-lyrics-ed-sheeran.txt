I fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits
Light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lay with me
Sew your heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet
Underneath shooting star
If it helps you sleep
And hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe
There's a firefly
Loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
And I'd lie
If I don't feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes
There's a firefly
Loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
And I'd lie
If I don't feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes
Teach my skin
Those new tricks
Warm me up
With your lips
Heart to heart
Melt me down
It's too cold
In this town
Close your eyes
Lean on me
Face to mouth
Lips to cheek
Feeling numb
In my feet
You're the one
To help me
Get to sleep
And hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe
There's a firefly
Loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
And I'd lie
If I don't feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes
There's a firefly
Loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
And I'd lie
If I don't feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes
only been
One night of love
And maybe
That is not enough
Hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't belive
only been
One night of love
And maybe
That's not enough
Hold me tight
Don't let me breathe
Feeling like
You won't believe
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
and I'd lie
If I don't feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it
Before it burns this place down
and I'd lie
If I don't feel so right
But the world looks better
Through your eyes
