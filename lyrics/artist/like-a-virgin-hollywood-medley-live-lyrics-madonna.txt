Britney Spears:
I made it through the wilderness. Somehow I
Made it through. Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you. I was beat incomplete.
I've been had. I was sad and blue, but you
Made me feel, yeah, you made me feel shiny
And new. Oh, oh.

Like a virgin, ooooh, touched for the very
First time, oh. Like a virgin when your
Heart beats next to mine, oh oh oooh yeah.

Oooooh. Oooooh. Oooooh.
