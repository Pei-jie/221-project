I feel like I had plastic surgery, 'cause the day I looked in the mirror realised I'm faced with neglection.
Feeling like I'm in the belly of the beast, trying to get out, I don't even think it knows that it's pregnant.
Stuck in the dream of deception similar to a scene from Inception
Looking at reviews from the last show baffled, thinking "how come I didn't even get a mention?"
Shocking. I think somebody put too many plugs in my extension.
I sign to music for seventeen years now I'm wondering why he doesn't want an extension.
I'm being ignored even the crowds just staring, see the tension. Now I'm on the stage feeling like a mobile phone in the basement 'cause I got no reception.
Ah, no bars, get it? Now I'm choking, no bars, get it? It turned cloudy, no stars, get it? Then I hit the ground so hard, headache.
Ah, it's mad. I should be proud right now but I'm sad, 'cause me and the world are out of touch like the relationship between me and my dad.

I'm out of touch in a cold December
Now
Keep Me Warm
I'm out of sight
With All these things I've done
don't hold me down now
It's more than I can take
I'm out of sight
now
in a cold December.

Uh, my mum walks past me. Mother of praise ask me why i have left them
I didn't know I broke up with my girlfriend 'til I saw her with someone else in Beckton.
I text her, "you dissed it." She don't reply like it's none of my business.
My mind goes round in circles it keeps on rolling, rolling more than Limp Bizkit.
howd you do me so wicked? Something must've happened, how did I miss this?
Love turns to pain expressed with rage. I want justice but I got no witness (help).
Now I'm powerless. Probably why I'm fascinated with misfits.
I guess I'm single, not happy, 'cause my heart doesn't feel like triplets. Nah, three, nobody understands but me.
I don't think I got no-one but myself so when I'm broke I still say I got p.
Ah, it's mad. I should be proud right now but I'm sad, 'cause me and the world are out of touch like the relationship between me and my dad.

So many thoughts battle me, got me holding my head in agony, trying to put the pieces together and figure out if this nightmare is really reality.
So many turning their back on me (wait) they're slowly coming back to me, all I can see is the word tragedy but I didn't think there was a fatality.
Uh, damn, I think I know why I don't see my dad, I think I know why my mum walks fast, and why me and my girlfriend don't chat.
See, all this time I thought I was mad, I know why I'm not proud and why I'm sad. I'm out of sight and touch 'cause back in March I don't think I survived that crash.
