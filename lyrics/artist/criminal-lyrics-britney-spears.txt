He is a hustler, he's no good at all
He is a loser, he's a bum
(Bum, bum, bum)
He lies, he fluffs he's unreliable
He is a sucker with a gun
(Gun, gun, gun)
I know you told me I should stay away
I know you said he's just a dog astray
He is a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart
But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy
He is a villain of the devil's law
He is a killer just for fun
(Fun, fun, fun)
That mans a snitch and unpredictable
He's got no conscience, he got none
(None, none, none)
All I know, should let go but no
'Cause he's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart
But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy
And he's got my name tattooed on his arm
His lucky charm, so I guess its okay
He's with me
And I hear people talk
(People talk)
Trying to make remarks, keep us apart
But I don't even hear I don't care
But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy
But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy
But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy
