Pitbull
pop
One time for my freaks that know what to do
When I skeet, skeet, that like it hard
Rough, face down, ass up, yes, sir
That like their hair pulled
When you beat from the back
That's what I like
But mami, can you really get down like that?
She's freaky, she knows how to do what I like just right
She's freaky, she likes you to talk dirty all night
She's freaky, she likes her ass slapped when she rides
She's freaky an' a freak is what I need in my life
One, little two, little three, little four
Five, little six, little seven, little hoes
Now callin' all freaks that like blind folds
Fi, fi, fo, fum
Go ahead an' blow me now
I need a freak to hold me down
I like the way you move an' the way you do
The things you do, can I get at you?
I'm just tellin' you the truth
Maybe I'm too blunt, but why front?
You got it goin' on, just pull up your skirt
I know what to do with your thong
I'ma pull it to the side an' rub it down right
Let me know if I'm wrong
She's freaky, she knows how to do what I like just right
She's freaky, she likes you to talk dirty all night
She's freaky, she likes her ass slapped when she rides
She's freaky an' a freak is what I need in my life
She's freaky, she knows how to do what I like just right
She's freaky, she likes you to talk dirty all night
She's freaky, she likes her ass slapped when she rides
She's freaky an' a freak is what I need in my life
Look at those eyes, look at those thighs
I could tell by the way she act
That she's freaky an' knows how to keep secrets
An' knows how to throw it back right
Go ahead an' hurt me
Put it on me, put it on me
Throw it back like an old jersey
I want y'all, I want y'all
To get loose, get crunk
Get high, get drunk to the point
Of no return, take one more shot
And feel the burn
Now, work it out, shake that thing 'til you can't no more
Now, work it out, take that thing down to the floor
Now, work it out, shake that thing 'til you can't no more
Now, work it out, take that thing down to the floor
She's freaky, she knows how to do what I like just right
She's freaky, she likes you to talk dirty all night
She's freaky, she likes her ass slapped when she rides
She's freaky an' a freak is what I need in my life
She's freaky, she knows how to do what I like just right
She's freaky, she likes you to talk dirty all night
She's freaky, she likes her ass slapped when she rides
She's freaky an' a freak is what I need in my life
Freaky, freaky, right
Freaky, freaky, all night
Freaky, freaky, ride
Freaky, freaky, what I need in my life
Freaky, freaky, right
Freaky, freaky, all night
Freaky, freaky, ride
Freaky, freaky, what I need in my life
Freaky, freaky, right
Freaky, freaky, all night
Freaky, freaky, ride
Freaky, freaky, what I need in my life
