Gargoyles, standing at front of your gate,
Trying to tell me to wait,
But I cant wait to see you.
So I run like Im mad,
To heaven's door.
I dont wanna be bad,
I wont cheat you no more.
Roses, Bel Air, take me there,
Ive been waiting to meet you.
Palm trees in the light,
I can see, late at night.
Darling Im willing to greet you.
Come to me baby.
Spotlight, bad baby, youve got a flare
For the violent-est kind of love anywhere out there.
Mon Amour, sweet child of mine, you're divine.
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's okay to shine?
Roses, Bel Air, take me there,
Ive been waiting to meet you,
Palm trees in the light,
I can see, late at night.
Darling Im willing to greet you,
Come to me baby.
Dont be afraid of me,
Dont be ashamed.
Walk in the way of my soft resurrection.
I know the roses, I've counted so,
I know your name.
Lead me to war with your brilliant direction.
Roses, Bel Air, take me there,
Ive been waiting to meet you.
Palm trees in the light,
I can see, late at night.
Darling Im willing to greet you,
Come to me baby.
Roses, Bel Air, take me there,
Ive been waiting to meet you.
Grenadine, sunshine,
Can it fade inside of mine?
Darling Im willing to greet you,
Come to me baby.
