Paramore
rock
I feel happy, I feel sad
I feel like running through the walls
I'm overjoyed, I'm undecided
I don't know who I am
Well, maybe I'm not perfect, at least I'm workin' on it,
22 is like the worst idea that I have ever had
It's too much pain, it's too much freedom
What should I do with this?
it's not the way you plan it
It's how you make it happen
Yeah, it's how you make it happen
It's such a cold cold world (hello cold world)
And I can't get out
So I'll just make the best of everything I'll never have
It's such a cold cold world (hello cold world)
And it's got me down
But I'll get right back up as long as it spins around
Hello cold world
(oh woah oh oh oh woah ohh)
Girls and boys keep lining up to see if they can measure up
And they look good and they feel wild but it will never be enough
You say you're really hurting, at least you're feeling something,
We can hope and we can pray that everything will work out fine,
But you can't just stay down on your knees
The revolution is outside
You wanna make a difference, get out and go and get it
Woah, get out and go and get it
It's such a cold cold world (hello cold world)
And I can't get out
So I'll just make the best of everything I'll never have
It's such a cold cold world (hello cold world)
And it's got me down
But I'll get right back up as long as it spins around
Hello cold world
(oh oh woah woah ohhh ah)
Don't need my eyes open wide,
(oh oh woah woah ohh ah)
I just wanna feel something
It's such a cold cold world (hello cold world)
And I can't get out
So I'll just make the best of everything I'll never have
It's such a cold cold world (hello cold world)
And it's got me down,
But I'll get right back up as long as it spins around
spins around
(oh woah woah ohh)
Hello cold world
(oh oh woah woah ohh)
Hello cold world.
