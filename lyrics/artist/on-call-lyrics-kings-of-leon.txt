She said call me now baby, I'd come running
She said call me now baby, I'd come running
If you call me now baby, I'd come running
I'm on call to be there, one and all to be there
When I fall to pieces, Lord you know
I'll be there waiting to be there, to be there
I'm on call to be there, one and all to be there
When I fall to pieces, Lord you know
I'll be there waiting
I'm gon' brawl, so be there, one for all I'll be there
When they fall to pieces, Lord you know
I'll be there laughing
I'd come a-running
I'd come a-running
I'd come a-running
To be there, to be there
I'm on call to be there
I'm on call to be there
I'm on call to be there
I'm on call to be there
