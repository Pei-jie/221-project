[Chris Brown]
You've got that smile,
That only heaven can make.
I pray to God everyday,
That you keep that smile.
[Justin Bieber]
Yeah, you are my dream,
Theres not a thing I wont do.
I'll give my life up for you,
Cos you are my dream.
[Bridge]
And baby, everything that I have is yours,
You will never go cold or hungry.
I'll be there when you're insecure,
Let you know that youre always lovely.
Girl, cos you are the only thing that I got right now
[Chorus]
One day when the sky is falling,
I'll be standing right next to you,
Right next to you.
Nothing will ever come between us,
I'll be standing right next to you,
Right next to you.
[Chris Brown]
You had my child,
You make my life complete.
Just to have your eyes on little me,
Thatd be mine forever.
[Bridge]
And baby, everything that I have is yours
You will never go cold or hungry
Ill be there when youre insecure
Let you know that youre always lovely
Girl, cos you are the only thing that I got right now
[Chorus]
One day when the sky is falling,
Ill be standing right next to you,
Right next to you.
Nothing will ever come between us,
Ill be standing right next to you,
Right next to you.
[Bridge]
Were made for one another
Me and you
And I have no fear
I know well make it through
One day when the sky is falling
Ill be standing right next to you
Ohh ohh ohh ohhhhh
[Chorus]
One day when the sky is falling,
Ill be standing right next to you,
Right next to you.
Nothing will ever come between us,
Ill be standing right next to you,
Right next to you.
Oh nah nah
Oh yeah
Stand by my side
When the sky falls
Oh baby
Ill be there
Youve got that smile,
That only heaven can make.
I pray to God everyday,
To keep you forever.
