If I go hard, let me tell you that its worth it
Play the right cards, I ain't afraid to work it
Brush 'em right off, when they say I dont deserve it
Hands on my heart, you keep my fire burning
Ooh it feels so crazy when you scream my name
Love it when you rock me over every day
When I think about it I could go insane
Here we are as beautiful, I'm blown away
If this is a dream, won't open my eyes,
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild
If this is a dream, won't open my eyes,
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild
When it get rough and the rain starts pouring
I turn up the heat 'cuz the drama ain't important
Let em all talk talk, I'ma just ignore it
Hands on my heart, you you keep me moving forward
Ooh it feels so crazy when you scream my name
[Big Sean]
B.I.G. Sean duh, OK
Today I woke up feeling like the mayor
I spend about an hour looking in the mirror
As I should, as much as I've been through
It's a wonder I look this damn good
I could probably make it out any situation that you try to put me in to
If I swim with the piranhas guaranteed that I'mma probably have a fish dinner
I met a young girl with a sexy shape like Jessie J
The we escapade
Where its extra shape
She make me want to give in not take like collection plates
Woah
All the awards, bras, cars, wall to wall
Is all a mirage
And I could lose it all tonight
Just to show the world I could do it twice
This is my life
If this is a dream, won't open my eyes,
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild
If this is a dream, won't open my eyes,
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild
Di-Di-Di-DIZZEE!
[DIZZEE RASCAL]
Rass Collar, double the dollar
I'm a jetsetter, brother more hits than a white collar
But I can't be boxed
Flow tight like Bob Marley's locks,
I can't be dropped
I'm at the peak and I can't be topped
I'm wilding out
I've lost the plot
I can't be stopped
Pull up in a Narley Warri, buy me what?
Opposite, I can't believe
If I'll ever get the party what? I can't be blocked
10 years plus running the game
You britons just come in the game
But now I'm coming again
To get the people going dumb and insane
A hundred thousand people going bonkers in the mother marine
Women on shoulders, tops off, shouting my name
I'm all in their brain
Why would I complain?
I thought I was the boy in the corner
But I'm in a penthouse
Now your boy is a bawler
I'm living
If this is a dream, won't open my eyes,
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild
If this is a dream, won't open my eyes,
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild
