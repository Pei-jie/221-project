Verse 1
Don't try to cover up your
Your new flame that's seathing through your eyes
I can see it from 10 feet away
And I know just who is burning
With every kiss you deny
So what makes you think that I still care
Or still want you anymore
Chorus
So how long
Has this been
Going on
And one more thing tell me
Was she the reason
You stomped on my heart
And moved on so quickly
Verse 2
You could call it pure torture
Watching your every move with her
Oh just the thought of it
Knowing what goes on between you makes me sick
I should have noticed
I should have noticed
When she came into the picture
You were always with her
And she's not leaving
Uh uh
Chorus
So how long
Has this been
Going on
And one more thing tell me
Was she the reason
You stomped on my heart
Bridge
You called me shady
And now she's your babydoll
She won you over
Over to break it off
And this time just maybe
Maybe you went a little far
I'm sick of cryin about
About your new flame
That's soon to burn out
Chorus
Ooo
Oh oh
Ooh
I'm done
