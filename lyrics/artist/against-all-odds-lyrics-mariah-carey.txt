How can I just let you walk away
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath with you
You're the only one who really knew me at all
How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tear
You're the only one who really knew me at all
So take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
There's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
So take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face
I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all
So take a look at me now
And there's just an empty space
There's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
So take a look at me now
Cause theres just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And thats what Ive got to face
Take a good look at me now
Cause lll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
Thats the chance Ive got to take
Oh, take a look at me now
