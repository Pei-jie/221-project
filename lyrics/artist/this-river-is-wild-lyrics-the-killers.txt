rock
Leaves are falling down
On the beautiful ground
I heard a story from the man in red
He said the leaves are falling down
Such a beautiful sound
Son I think you better go ahead
But you always hold your head up high
'Cause it's a long, long, long way down
This town was meant for passing through
Boy it ain't nothing new
Now im goin to show'em that the world stayed round
But it's a long, long, long way down
You better run for the hills before they burn
Listen to the sound of the world
Then watch it turn
I just want to show you what I know
And catch you when the current lets you go
Or should I just get along with myself?
I never did get along with everybody else
I've been trying hard to do what's right
But you know I could stay here all night
And watch the clouds fall from the sky
This river is wild
This river is wild
Run for the hills before they burn
Listen to the sound of the world
Then watch it turn
But shake a little
Sometimes I'm nervous when I talk
I shake a little
Sometimes I hate the line I walk
I just want to show you what I know
And catch you when the current lets you go
Or should I just get along with myself?
I never did get along with everybody else
Ive been trying hard to do what's right
But you know I could stay here all night
And watch the clouds fall from the sky
Because this river is wild
Godspeed you boy
This river is wild
Now Adam's taking bombs
And he's stuck on his mom
Because that bitch keeps trying to make him pray
He's with the hippie in the park coming over the dark
Just trying to get some of that little girl play
You better run for the hills before they burn
Listen to the sound of the world
Then watch it turn
I just want to show you what I know
And catch you when the current lets you go
Or should I get along with myself?
I never did get along with everybody else
I've been trying hard to do what's right
But you know I could stay here all night
And watch the clouds fall from the sky
And pain is hell in me tonight
Because this river is wild
Godspeed you boy
This river is wild
This river is wild
Godspeed you boy
This river is wild
Now the cars are everywhere
Lace'in dust at the fairground
I don't think I ever seen so many headlights
But there's something pulling me
The circus and the crew
Well they're just passing through
Making sure that merry still goes round
But it's a long, long, long way down
