I know I can't take one more step towards you
Cause all that's waiting is regret
And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore?
I lost the love I loved the most
I learned to live, half-alive
And now you want me one more time
And who do you think you are?
Runnin' 'round leaving scars
Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart
I wished that I missed the first time
that we kissed cause you broke
all your promises. who do think you are?
runnin' 'round leaving scars collecting your
jar of hearts and tearing love apart
you gonna catch a cold from the ice inside
you soul. don't come back for me
don't come back at all.
Who do you think you are?
who do you think you are?
