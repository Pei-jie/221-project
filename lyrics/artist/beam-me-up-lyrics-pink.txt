Pink
pop
There's a whole other conversation going on
In a parallel universe
Where nothin' breaks and nothin' hurts
There's a waltz playin' frozen in time
Blades of grass on tiny bare feet
I look at you and you're lookin' at me
Could you beam me up
Give me a minute
I don't know what I'd say in it
I'd probably just stare
Happy just to be there holdin' your face
Beam me up
Let me be lighter
I'm tired of bein' a fighter
I think a minute's enough
Just beam me up
Saw a blackbird soarin' in the sky
Barely a breath I caught one last sight
Tell me that was you sayin' goodbye
There are times I feel the shiver and cold
It only happens when I'm on my own
That's how you tell me I'm not alone
Could you beam me up
Give me a minute
I don't know what I'd say in it
I'd probably just stare
Happy just to be there holdin' your face
Beam me up
Let me be lighter
I'm tired of bein' a fighter
I think a minute's enough
Just beam me up
In my head I see your baby blues
I hear your voice and I
I break in two and now there's
One of me with you
So when I need you can I send you a sign
I'll burn a candle and turn off the lights
I'll pick a star and watch you shine
Just beam me up
Give me a minute
I don't know what 'd say in it
I'd probably just stare
Happy just to be there holdin' your face
Beam me up
Let me be lighter
I'm tired of bein' a fighter
I think a minute's enough
Beam me up
Beam me up
Beam me up
Could you beam me up
