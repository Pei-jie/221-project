I'm Not A Slut
I Just Love Love
Tell me something new
Cause' I heard this:
"Okay I'll fuck you"
A little taste test
You'll be my little friend
You'll be my little friend
You'll be my little friend
And they think
We fall in love
But that's not in
Just want to get some
And that's some shit
You'll be my little friend
You'll be my little friend
You'll be my little friend
Yeaaaah yeah yeah yeah
I got a little piece of you-hoooo
And it's just like woo-hooo
Wam Bam!
Thank you ma'am
Woo-hooo
I'm a slut like you
You say you're
Looking for a fool
And I'm just like:
"Me too"
I'm gonna let you know the truth
I'm a slut like you
Sitting with my friends
And we're picking
Who we might let in
Them boys are starving
They're just our little friends
They're just our little friends
They're just our little friends
(Listen you little fucker)
You think you call the shots
I just bought you some
Drink up, your ride's gone
This might be fun
You're now my little friend
You're now my little friend
You're now my little friend
Yeaaaah yeah yeah yeah
I got a little piece of you-oooo
And it's just like
Woo-hooo
Wam Bam!
Thank you ma'am
Woo-hooo
I'm a slut like you
You say you're
Looking for a fool
And I'm just like:
"Me too"
I'm gonna let you know the truth
I'm a slut like you
You don't win a prize
With your googly eyes
I'm not a cracker Jack
You can't go Inside
Unless I let you Jack
Or Sam
Fuck what's your name again?
You male, come now
You caveman, sit down
You shh, don't ruin it

And it's just like woo
