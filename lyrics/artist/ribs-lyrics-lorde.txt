The drink you spilt all over me
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time
The drink you spilt all over me
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
The drink you spilt all over me
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old
We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old
This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old
I want them back
I want them back
The minds we had
The minds we had
How all the thoughts
How all the thoughts
Moved 'round our heads
Moved 'round our heads
I want them back
I want them back
The minds we had
The minds we had
It's not enough to feel the lack
It's not enough to feel the lack
I want them back
I want them back
I want them
You're the only friend I need
Sharing beds like little kids
And laughing 'til our ribs get tough
But that will never be enough
You're the only friend I need
Sharing beds like little kids
And laughing 'til our ribs get tough
But that will never be enough
