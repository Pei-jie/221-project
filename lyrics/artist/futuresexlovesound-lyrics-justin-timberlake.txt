FutureSex/LoveSound
You know what you want
And that makes you just like me
See everybody says you're hot baby
But can you make it hot for me?
Said if you're thinking about holding back
Don't worry girl cause I'm gonna make it so easy
So slide a little bit closer to me little girl
See daddy's on a mission to please, wait a second
She's hopped up on me, Ive got her in my zone
Her body's pressed up on me, I think she's ready to blow
Must be my FutureSex/LoveSound
And when it goes down, baby all ya gotta do is
Just tell me which way you like that
All you gotta do is tell me which way you like that
Do you like it like this? Do you like it like that?
Tell me which way you like that
Tell me which way you like that
You can't stop baby
You can't stop once you've turned me on
And your enemies are your thoughts baby
So just let em go
Cause all I need is a moment alone to give you my tone
And put you outta control
And after you let it in, we'll be skin to skin
It's just so natural, wait a second
She's hopped up on me, I've got her in my zone
Her body's pressed up on me, I think she's ready to blow
Must be my FutureSex/LoveSound
And when it goes down, baby all ya gotta do is
Just tell me which way you like that
All you gotta do is tell me which way you like that
Do you like it like this? Do you like it like that?
Tell me which way you like that
Tell me which way you like that

Now wait a second
She's hopped up on me, I've got her in my zone
Her body's pressed up on me, I think she's ready to blow
Must be my FutureSex/LoveSound
And when it goes down, baby all ya gotta do is
Just tell me which way you like that
All you gotta do is tell me which way you like that
I know you like it like that
Tell me which way you like that
Tell me which way you like that
