rock
Aha shake, taper jean girl with a motel face
Aha shake, bury your eyes in a secret place
Aha shake, black as night on a Sunday
Cunts watch their bodies, no room for make-up
I think he's tasted, tasted the watcher
Heartbreak knockin' 'em down like the seventh grade
Heartbreak, cigarettes and song with a winter's chafe
Heartbreak keep like my daughter and a run away
Cunts watch their bodies, no room for make-up
I think he's tasted, tasted the watcher
Aha shake, tapered jean girl kills me
Cunts watch their bodies, no room for make-up
I think he's tasted, tasted the watcher
