Now, girl, this little game you play
You don't stop til you go too far
So, what's a man like me to say?
With a bullet laying in my heart
Bridge 1
Damn, love
We go from so hot to so cold
What I am gonna do without this damn love?
Is this shit insane or insane love?
I guess that's the way we play
Chorus
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, only when I walk away
What's that, baby, what you say?
Cause you don't wanna light up this torch
Cause I'll burn it down all the way
Burning down til there ain't no more
Bridge 2
Damn, love
How did the sound get so
Amped up
Turned up inside it's this
Damn love
Is this shit insane or insane love?
I guess that's the way we play
Chorus
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, only when I walk away
What's that, baby, what you say?
Cause you don't wanna light up this torch
Cause I'll burn it down all the way
Burning down til there ain't no more
Cold
So cold x2
You should see the look on your face
Baby, when I finish what you start
I can't hear a word you say
With a bullet laying in your heart
Bridge 3
Damn, girl
How did this shit get out of my
hands, love
I laid you to rest you said
"Damn love"
This shit's insane it's insane love
Ain't that the way we play
Chorus
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, only when I walk away
( only when I walk away)
( only when I walk away)
You love me don't ya?
(Only when I walk away)
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, only when I walk away
She loves me now, she loves me not
She loves me now, only when I walk away
only when I walk away
only when I walk away
Hold up
only when I walk away
She only love me when I walk away
Call me on the phone tell me baby please stay
She only love me when I walk away
Calling, running, begging, crying baby please stay X3
She only love me when I walk away
I said fuck you bitch you don't care what you say
