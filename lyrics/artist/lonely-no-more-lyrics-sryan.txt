[Sryan]
Another dream, another day
I've seen too many fade away
So if you wonder how to make it right
Give me everything, everything tonight
Cause I don't want to be lonely no more
I don't want to feel empty no more
Only you could unbreak this heartache I've carried around
Don't wanna be lonely no more, no more
[Chorus]
Take me in, take me home
I can't stand to be alone
Help me paint the picture of my life
Don't you disappear and leave me here tonight
Cause I don't wanna be lonely no more

[One Direction]
Just relax, enjoy yourself
I tell you about my perfect day
They're tellin' me the dos and don'ts
But nobody's askin' me what I desire
Cause I don't want to be lonely no more
I don't want to feel empty no more
Only you could unbreak this heartache I've carried around
Don't wanna be lonely no more, no more
[Chorus]
Take me in, take me home
I can't stand to be alone
Help me paint the picture of my life
Don't you disappear and leave me here tonight
Cause I don't wanna be lonely no more
[Beat]
Lonely no more
Lonely no more
Lonely no more
Lonely no more
