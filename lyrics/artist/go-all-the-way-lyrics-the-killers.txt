rock
I never knew how complete love could be
til she kissed me and said, baby, please
Chorus:
Go all the way
it feels so right (feels so right)
being with you here tonight
Please go all the way
just hold me close ( hold me close)
Dont ever let me go
I couldnt say what I wanted to say
till she whispered I love you
Chorus:
So please, go all the way
it feels so right (feels so right)
being with you here tonight
Please go all the way
just hold me close ( hold me close)
Dont ever let me go
Before her love, I was cruel and mean
I had a hole in the place
where my heart should have been
but now Ive changed,
and it feels so strange
I come alive when she does,
all those things to me..
and she says
(Come on) Come on,
(Come on) Come on
(Come on) Come on
(Come on) Come on
I need you (Come on)
I love you (Come on)
I need you (Come on)
Chorus:
Please go all the way
it feels so right (feels so right)
being with you here tonight
Please go all the way
just hold me close ( hold me close)
Dont ever let me go
