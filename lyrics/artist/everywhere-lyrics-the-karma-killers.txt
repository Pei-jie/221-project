[Sryan]
Get your power, your masks and capes snatched
The sleepy summer sky
The lovers passing by
All the cities too
Make me think of you
A world designed for you and me
I always realised with every new sunrise
[Adam E]
I've never ever known a love that lasted
Beyond the thrill of a first kiss
This love of ours has utterly surpassed it
And now my bliss is this
[Everyone]
Every time I'm far from home
I am never quite alone
Whenever we're apart
You're always in my heart
For you are with me everywhere, everywhere
[Peter]
You're everything I know
That makes me believe
I'm not alone
I'm very bored
But I know the thing to brighten this moment is
Go out and play with my friends
[Sean]
I've never ever known a love that lasted
Beyond the thrill of a first kiss
This love of ours has utterly surpassed it
And now my bliss is this
[Everyone]
Every time I'm far from home
I am never quite alone
Whenever we're apart
You're always in my heart
For you are with me everywhere, everywhere
Every time I'm far from home
I am never quite alone
Whenever we're apart
You're always in my heart
For you are with me everywhere, everywhere
Woahhh! Woahhhhhh!!! Woahhhh!!!
Woahhh! Woahhhhhh!!! Woahhhh!!!
[Ed Sheeran]
I know there's a thing to do when you just think of it
I am wearing a scarf on a winter's cold day
I need to go outside to play with my friends
But it is too icy and too co.........ld
Fresh and I'm fresh and my fresh just get fresher
Diamonds in production glow greater than the pressure
None turn to some and the some turn to more
The more turn to many and the many turn to all
Shouting on my nothing like it's nothing at all
To not knowing what ya got till it got gone
Same song, new time signature
[Everyone]
Every time I'm far from home
I am never quite alone
Whenever we're apart
You're always in my heart
For you are with me everywhere, everywhere
Every time I'm far from home
I am never quite alone
Whenever we're apart
You're always in my heart
For you are with me everywhere, everywhere
Every time I'm far from home
I am never quite alone
Whenever we're apart
You're always in my heart
For you are with me everywhere, everywhere
Woahhh! Woahhhhhh!!! Woahhhh!!!
Woahhh! Woahhhhhh!!! Woahhhh!!!
