Im tryin do it all tonight,
I got plans,
I got a certain lust for life,
And as it stands,
Everything is going as right,
As it can,
They tryin to shoot down my flight,
Before it lands,
Before it lands,
But you could miss me with all that,
Diss me then crawl back,
I really wish ya'll will fall back,
But gettin rich suppose to slove that,
And these days women make offers and who the hell am I to say,
No no no,
My ex send late night text cause she dont know how to let,
Go go go
She in love,
And as for them pretty light skinned models standin in the cold oh yea they with us,
Let them girls in for a drink,
And Im all in they ear,
Saying she should be the one I see,
Everytime that Im here but when am I really even here?
Black surburban wit the tent on it,
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it,
The game got these old hand prints on it,
But ima be the one to pour cement on it,
And start over,
And show up in a Margiela tux,
I dont really give a fuck,
And we only getting older,
So what i tend to do is to think of today as the past,
Its funny when u coming in first but you hope that you last,
You just hope that it last,
that it last,
that it last,
that it last,
that it last,

Throw your ones up in the air,
Throw your ones up in the air for her,
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up
