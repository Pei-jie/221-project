Girl, I can't believe what you do to me
Got a feeling that I'm running outta of time
And I really hope that you come closer

[Lil Twist]
Let closer up on that, hold up on that
Twizzy 'bout to pose up on that
don't waste the time we both need
don't regret this day when you leave!
Just get sprung of that, don't back of that
Once you turn on you can't turn back
Can't believe what I see Miley Ray J's dropped it on me! Twerk!
