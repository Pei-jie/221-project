We stay in, moving around, so low
Ask us where you went, we don't know
And don't care, don't care
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your bus and got gone and left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Passed on keep that dress on
Trying to get enough drinks in her system
Take her to the tele and make her a victim
Controlling the brain, ball, play you in the face
They shake the spot, she's just another case
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone, gone
There's belief, we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever
He's staying with a flack of 'em all, yeah
Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care, won't care
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks, because I'm at home, I won't be getting it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Chicks calling in the house, no stop
It's getting out of control, funnily, I can't take no more
He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend, oh
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone, gone
There's belief, we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We gone forever
We stay in, moving around, so low
Ask us where you went, we don't know
And don't care, don't care
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone and left us all alone
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone, gone
There's belief, we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We gone forever
We're gone forever
We're gone forever
