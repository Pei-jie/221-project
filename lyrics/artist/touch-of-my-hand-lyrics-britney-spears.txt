Im not ashamed of the things that I dream
I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene
Into the unknown, I will be bold
Going to places, I can be out of control
And I dont want to explain tonight
All the things Ive tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world so I
Can draw the blinds and Ill teach myself to fly
I love myself
Its not a sin
I cant control whats happenin
Cause I just discovered
Imaginations taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand
From the small of my back and the arch of my feet
Lately Ive been noticin the beautiful me
Im all in my skin and Im not gonna wait
Im into myself in the most precious way
And I dont want to explain tonight
All the things Ive tried to hide
I shut myself out from the world so I
Can draw the blinds and Ill teach myself to fly
Cause I just discovered
Imaginations taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand
Theres a world undefined
In my body and mind
I wont be left behind
Im already here
Cause I just discovered
Imaginations taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand
Cause I just discovered
Imaginations taking over
Another day without a lover
The more I come to understand
The touch of my hand
