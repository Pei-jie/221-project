[Drake - Chorus]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older somebody shoulda told ya
I'm on one
Yeah, fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one
Fuck it, I'm on one
A strong one
Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money that we got, never get that shit
Cause I'm on one
F-ck it I'm on one
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
You know what I'm like, oh yes, oh yeah
Oh yes, Oh yeah
Oh yes, Oh yeah
You know what I'm sippin, I teach you how to mix it
But you're the only one, cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches
They might catch me slippin'
So you're the only one, cause I don't trust these bitches
They might, they might catch me slippin' and put in something different
So your the only one
Cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches
They might catch me slippin'
So you're the only one
Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh ooo oooo oooo ooh
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Lets call up on drinkin, lets all get wasted
On drinkin', lets all get faded
Uh
Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the the muthaf-cking north side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sittin' courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You actin' like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me how the f-ck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show
I can tell, I can tell, I can tell certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess they don't really make 'em like me no more
Uh, you can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
Cause if I was what y'all created then I'd hate myself
But still, let them girls in,
And tell em all leave their cell phones on the table where we see 'em
I'm all day with it man, AM to the PM
Niggas hatin', I just wish they would say it when I see em all
That's that crap that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been gettin' lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women wanna f-ck like their me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think I can find it in you, in you
Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh ooooh, trust issues
Oh oooo oooo oooo ooh
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Lets call up on drinkin, lets all get wasted
On drinkin', lets all get faded
Oh yeah, oh yeah
ooooh ooooh trust issues
