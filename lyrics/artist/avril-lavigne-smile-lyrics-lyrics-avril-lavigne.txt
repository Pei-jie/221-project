You know that Im a crazy bitch
I do what I want, when I feel like it
All I wanna do is lose control
But you dont really give a shit
Ya go with it, go with it, go with it
Cause your fucking crazy
Rock n roll
You-ou said hey
Whats your name?
It took one look and
Now Im not the same.
Yeah, you said Hey
And since that day,
You stole my heart and youre the one to blame
Yeah
And thats why I smile.
Its been a while
Since everyday and everything has felt this right
And now
You turn it all around
And suddenly youre all I need
The reason why,
I-i-i, I smi-i-i-ile.
Last night I blacked out, I think.
What did you, what did you put in my drink?
I remember making out and then
Oh oh
I Woke up with a new tattoo
Your name was on me and my name was on you.
I would do it all over again
You-ou said hey (hey)
