Let me out,
Dont tell me everything,
Started out like any other day,
Must have gave the wrong impression,
Dont you understand where I belong?
Im not the one.
Stand again,
Cause aint nothing comes for free,
And thats the truth,
Ive been living in a fantasy,
Slip and slide,
A head trip heaven,
Self-denial such a wonderful and powerful thing,
Well Im not the one.
The morning dove sings with two broken wings,
Carry me home,
Im not afraid,
The stars in my eyes were shimmering lights,
Carry me home,
Dont let me fade away.
Stop the press,
The kids light is growing dim,
I took a month long slide,
Then the world came caving in,
When you self-destruct,
You wind up looking for a glimmer of hope,
But the writings on the wall,
Im not the one.
The morning dove sings with two broken wings,
Carry me home,
Im not afraid,
The stars in my eyes were shimmering lights,
Carry me home,
Dont let me fade.
Just how thick is your skin?
Just how sharp are your teeth?
Ohh,
Youve got a lot to learn.
Is there somewhere else I can win?
Is there something else to start over again?
From the summits edge,
To the cutting room floor,
I will be afraid no more.
The morning dove sings with two broken wings,
Carry me home,
Im not afraid,
The stars in my eyes were shimmering lights,
Carry me home,
Dont let me fade.
Carry me home,
Carry me.
Ooooh oohhh ohhhhh
