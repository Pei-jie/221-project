Throwing up a G note
Like i'm at a casino
I'm all fancy yeah

Im in the El Camino
And i pull up on the scene though
You know I'm a real OG
And baby i ain't from the T.O
You ain't messing with the clique though
Meet me on the 6th floor
Know you ain't a model
You should let me take some pics tho
Windows down
Speakers loud
Look down at my sneakers now
Got so many features
Tell the creatures just to beat it now
50 for that necklace
Look down at my set list
Got your girlfriend at my crib watching Netflix
Let's just admit that I'm the bestest
Guess this you ain't never ever on the guest list

(Verse 3 Juicy J)
Yessir
Ass everywhere
Throw them dollars in the air (mhmm)
Bring your swimming gear
Juicy J the millionaire (mhmm)
She pop that pussy on me
I fell back in the chair
Bands a make her dance
Molly make her lose them underwear
Booty cheeks
I'm geeked, (you know it)
All her friends are freaks (you know it)
And I think she love me
I've been hitting it for a week (swish)
I drill it
Slap it silly
Need a super freak like Ricky
I'm Rick James bitch
I slip myself a mickey
Got so much money in my pocket
With a real bad chick from the tropics
With silicone racks with a real big ass
Make her bounce it like hydraulics
Kevin Hart, I got purple on the plane (we smoking)
Let's call a bull (let's go)
Let's run a train (trippy)
