[Verse 1]
Roll the dice, double two
No more us, no me and you
What a struggle, I took a risk
Another life, another kiss
I start again, it keeps going
We're best friends, not even knowing
I win the race and then i fall
I gave it up, to have it all
[Pre 1]
We let go of love so we can go again
We don't hesitate to let somebody in
To build a home just to get lost (hey)
We fire it up just to burn it off
[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna hold hands with a stranger
I don't wanna walk when I just learnt how to run
I don't wanna care 'coz it's human nature
I don't wanna go go go go back to square one
[Hook 1]
Said she don't go wanna go back to square one
I just wanna be the one
[Verse 2]
In the dark, it's brand new
You're teaching me, I'm teaching you
Imagination, i wanna please
But I'm tired, of the tease
Give me substance, I need soul
Not just a moment, to come and go
It's not simple, it never is
Another life, another kiss
[Pre 2]
We let go of love so we can go again
We don't hesitate to let somebody in
To build a home just to get lost (hey)
We fire it up just to burn it off
[Chorus 2]
I don't wanna hold hands with a stranger
I don't wanna walk when I just learnt how to run
I don't wanna care 'coz it's human nature
I don't wanna go go go go back to square one
Don't take me back now
[Hook 2]
Said she don't wanna go go back to square one, she just wanna find the one
Someone that she needs she needs she needs
(Everybody sing)
She don't wanna go go back to square one, she just wanna find the one
Someone that she needs she needs she needs, Jessie
[Chorus 3]
I don't wanna hold hands with a stranger
I don't wanna walk when I just learnt how to run
I don't wanna care 'coz it's human nature
I don't wanna go go go go
[Chorus 4]
I don't wanna hold hands with a stranger
I don't wanna walk when I just learnt how to run
I don't wanna care 'coz it's human nature
I don't wanna go go go go back to square one
Don't take me back now
[Hook 3]
Said she don't wanna go go back to square one
She just wanna find the one
Someone that she needs she needs she needs
