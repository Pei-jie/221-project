I paint my nails black.
I dye my hair a darker shade... of brown,
because you like your women Spanish, dark, strong and proud.
I paint the sky black,
you said if you could have your way,
you'd make a night time what a day,
so it suits the mood of your soul...
Ohhh, what can I do?
Nothing, my sparrow blue.
Ohhhhh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful,
but you don't have a clue.
Sun and ocean blue,
they're magnificent,
it don't make sense to you.
Black beauty.
Ohhh oh oh.
Black beauty.
Ohhh oh.
I paint the house black,
my wedding dress black leather, too.
You have no room for light,
Love is lost on you.
I keep my lips red,
they seem like cherries in the spring.
Darling, you can't let everything seem so dark blue.
But, ohhh...
what can I do,
to turn you on,
or get through you?
Ohhh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful,
but you don't have a clue.
Sun and ocean blue,
they're magnificent,
it don't make sense to you.
Black beauty,
Ohhhh.
Black beauty,
ohhhh....
Black beauty,
ohhhh....
Black beauty,
ohhhh....
Black bea-u-uty,
ohhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh....
Black beauty baby...
Black beauty baby...
Ohhhh.... what can I do?
Life is beautiful,
but you don't have a clue...
Sun and ocean blue,
they're magnificent,
it don't make sense to you.
Black beauty,
Ohhhh.
Black beauty,
ohhhh....
Black beauty,
ohhhh....
Black beauty,
ohhhh....
