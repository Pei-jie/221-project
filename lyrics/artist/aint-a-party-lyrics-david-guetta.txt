Ain't a party without me no?
There's crazy everywhere that I go
One day I'll put it all behind
But trouble always seems to find me
Holding now a party
Get crazy with somebody
Are you feeling naughty?
I ain't even started
Ain't a party without me
A party without me
A party without me
I wanna see you raise your hands
Ain't party without me
A party without me
A party without me
I make the beats that make you dance
A party without me
A party without me
A party without me
Let me see your, see your hands
Let me see your, see your hands
It's my party, you can't stop me
I'll be higher, I'll be rocking
Show me your hands and see them dropping
No more lies, just keep us watching
I'll go wilder, I'll go hunt
Turn it up and keep it coming
Are you ready, are your ready, are you ready to go
Holding now a party
Get crazy with somebody
Are you feeling naughty?
Let's get it started
Ain't a party without me
A party without me
A party without me
I wanna see you raise your hands
Ain't party without me
A party without me
A party without me
I make the beats that make you dance
A party without me
A party without me
A party without me
Let me see your, see your hands
Let me see your, see your hands
