I like em bad-bad, baby, you could be the one
And if you wanna get trashed and have fun
Throw me holy in the sky like a pizza pie
You take my whole world, baby, and twist it to the right
Throw it in the air and whoop like dynamite
Throw me in the sky like a pizza pie
You know I like em bad, boy
Wrong side of the track, boy
You know I like em bad boy, like you
I like a man who cant care/kick it
So come around and hit me up
No other man can lick me like you
Everybodys saying youre no good for me
But they dont see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
But Im not gonna do it, baby
Everybodys saying youre no good for me
But they dont see the dirty stuff you do to me
Only shout a little but you give me more
Behind, behind closed doors
Behind closed doors (x3)
