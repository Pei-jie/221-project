There something about you that I like
It's something so captivating
Feels like your body belongs
Right next to mine
I'm going crazy in the moves that you're making
Your body it's on fire (Dura Dura Eeess)
I'm going crazy in the moves that you're making
Your body it's on fire (Dura Dura Eeess)
(Yandel)
We getting closer and closer now
Just you and I, we touch us slow
We let it go...
We getting closer and closer now
Just you and I, we can keep it between us
Nobody has to know...
