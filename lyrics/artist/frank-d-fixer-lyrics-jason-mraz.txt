Frank D. Fixer was a handyman
He could handle everything;
he was my granddad
He grew his own food
and fixed his own car
I watched it all happen
in our backyard
He'd reinvent the part
to fix the broken home
He restored the heart
Well I wish I was a fixer
I would fix you up inside
I would build you a town
if the world fell down
I wish I was that guy
If Frank D. Fixer were alive today
Well he may laugh at me
and he may have a lot to say
Well he might ask that I keep working for the family
To keep the bills all paid
and be his protege
What happened to the ground
right where we are
What happened to the family farm
Well I wish I was a fixer
I would fix you up inside
I would build you a town
if the world fell down
I wish I was that guy
Every evening breaking bread
He showed us who a real man is
No matter what my grandma said
He would never lose his head
Well I wish I was a fixer
I would fix you up inside
I would build you a town
if the world fell down
I wish I was that guy
Well I wish I was a farmer
I would grow you a garden of Eden
and I would bless our family
with the gifts that granddad handed me
How wonderful that would be
I'll make that guy be me
