Hey, Mr. Curiosity
Is it true what they've been sayin' about you?
Are you killin' me? You took care of the cat already
And for those who think it's heavy
Is it the truth or is it only gossip?
Call it mystery or anything
Just as long as you'd call me, I sent the message on
Did you get it when I left it? See this catastrophic event
It wasn't meant to mean no harm
But to think there's nothing wrong is a problem
I'm looking for love this time
Soundin' hopeful but it's making me cry
Love is a mystery
Mr. Curious, come back to me
Mr. Waiting, ever patient can't you see
That I'm the same, the way you left me?
In a hurry to spell check me
And I'm underlined already in envy green and pencil red
And I've forgotten what you've said
Will you stop working for the dead
And return Mr. Curious, well, I need some inspiration
It's my birthday and I cannot find no cause for celebration
The scenario is grave but I'll be braver when you save me
From this situation laden with hearsay
I'm looking for love this time
Soundin' hopeful but it's making me cry
And love is a mystery
Mr. Curiosity, be Mr. Please, do come and find me
Oh, find, find me, find me [Incomprehensible]
I'm looking for love this time
Soundin' hopeful but it's making me cry
Tryin' not to ask why
'Cause love is a mystery
Mr. Curiosity, be Mr. Please, do come and find me
Love is blindin' when the timing's never right
Oh, who am I to beg for difference
Findin' love in just an instant
Well I don't mind, at least I've tried
Well I tried, I tried
