You are the music
You are the reason I believe
You are the seasons
You are the blessings I receive
You are the answer
Lighting the fires of passion burning deep
You are inspiration
Running like a million rivers over me
And you take me
And you take me
To a place I've never been
And you take me
And you take me
And you take me
To a place I've never been
Oh, you are the music, yeah yeah
Woah, you are the reason I believe
Woah, you are the music
Woah, you are the reason I believe
You are the reason, yeah
You are the reason, yeah
You [Incomprehensible] hear the music, yeah
You are my soul, yeah yeah yeah
You, you, you, you
And you take me
And you take me
And you take me
And you take me
And you take me
To a place I've never been
And you take me
And you take me
And you take me
To a place I've never been
Oh, you take me
Take me, take me, take me, take me
To a place I've never been, no
