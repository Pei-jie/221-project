Pink
pop
We don't wanna go home
We're bad people and we do bad things
Yea, we don't wanna go home
We don't wanna, we don't wanna go
We're bad people and we do bad things
Here we go, don't you know?
We're the ones that keep it wicked
Rock n' Roll, all good, mix it up
That's my ticket
Cruisin' in my Cadillac
Escalade trickin'
Sometimes like it easy
Sometimes like it rugged
Keep control, don't you know?
Hit the floor, run for cover
Yea, flew around the world
About fifty times over
From New York to LA
To the white cliffs of Dover
The road can be my enemy
The road can be my lover
Watch how we do this here
We don't wanna go home
Yea, watch how we do this here
Oh no, no, we don't wanna go home
From the humble neighborhoods
We're takin' over the dance floor
We don't wanna go
From the humble neighborhoods
We're gettin' out of control
We're bad people and we do bad things
Here we go, hit the road
We're the ones that make it crazy
Mix it up, try our luck
This ain't time to get lazy
Meetin' at eleven in the hotel lobby
Same faces, different places
Never knowin' where we goin' now
Someday I'm gonna die
But it won't be from boredom
If you've got the skills then I suggest
That you throw down
Meet us at the spot
'Cause it's gonna be a showdown
Now, you can't ride the bus
Man you better cool down
Watch how we do this here
Yea, watch how we do this here
We don't wanna go home
From the humble neighborhoods
We're takin' over the dance floor
We don't wanna go
From the humble neighborhoods
We're gettin' out of control
We're bad people and we do bad things
Here we go, don't you know?
We're the ones that keep it wicked
Rock n' Roll, all good, mix it up
That's my ticket
Cruisin' in my Cadillac
Escalade trickin'
Sometimes like it easy
Sometimes like it rugged
Keep control, don't you know?
Hit the floor, run for cover
Yea flew around the world
About fifty times over
From New York to LA
To the white cliffs of Dover
The road can be my enemy
The road can be my lover
Watch how we do this here
We don't wanna go
Yea, watch how we do this here
Oh, no, no, we don't wanna go home
From the humble neighborhoods
We're takin' over the dance floor
We don't wanna go
From the humble neighborhoods
We're gettin' out of control
We're bad people and we do bad things
Oh, we don't wanna go
We don't wanna go
We don't wanna go
