Awwel marra shuftek etghayyar hali
Ihssass ghrib ma'araft mali
Bghitek habbitek etkuni dyali
N'ish...hyati ma'ak
Hluwwa bezzaf yehssan e'wani

Yghanni b kul lughat..

[Chorus :]
[Pitbull]
I play this game closely
For the bread and butter huh!
Yeah they try to toast me
I'm married to the game
But the game don't love me
Hey don't leave me in a heartbeat
That's why I'm cold-blooded
When I say I love you,I mean it deeply
I can't see life without you living with me
And if you love someone I know you feel me
When I say before they take you they want to kill me
I'm talking they gonna have to army marine navyseal me
Yeah the world knows Pitbull babe
you know the real me
I play any hand that deal me
So tell that dealer he gon' have that deal with me
even when you don't I'mma hunt you like a Chris Reber
time out final fall!
So til' the sky comes crushing down
World falls apart
'til death do us part
You're my heart for sure!
[Chorus :]
[Ahmed Chawki]
Makayen lash nghayyar men hali
Wala nhawel nkun metali
Baraka ghir jnuni w hbali a'lik
Khalliwni hdak
Haja wahda ghankulhalek
Men had lahda wejdi halek
Kul sa'ada nwerrihalek
W'entir ana w yak
[Bridge :]
Ohhh!
Ya habibi la la
Haram A'lik tkhallini wahdi f yoom
yemchi men e'ini noom men khufi a'lik
