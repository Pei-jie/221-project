My state of mind
Has finally got the best of me
I need you next to me
I'll try to find
A way that I can get to you
Just wanna get to you
The world I see is perfect now
You're all around
With you, I can breathe
Until you're mine, I have to find
A way to fill this hole inside
I've got to fight
Without you here by my side
Until you're mine, not gonna be
Even close to complete
I won't rest until you're mine
Mine
Alone inside
I can only hear your voice
Ringing through the noise
I can't find my mind
Keeps on coming back to you
Always back to you
Wanted something out of reach
It's killing me, you're all I see
Until you're mine, I have to find
A way to fill this hole inside
I've got to fight
Without you here by my side
Until you're mine, not gonna be
Even close to complete
I won't rest until you're mine
Mine
Just stop wondering
If we were meant to be
Forget about fate
Just hold me
I'm ready to begin
The waiting has to end
Right now, today
I've got to find a way, yeah
Mine, until you're mine
Until you're mine, I have to find
A way to fill this hole inside
I've got to fight
Without you here by my side
Until you're mine, not gonna be
Even close to complete
I won't rest until you're mine
My state of mind
Has finally got the best of me
I need you next to me
