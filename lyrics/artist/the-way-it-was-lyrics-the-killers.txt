I drove through the desert last night.
I carried the weight of our last fight.
Elvis singing Dont be Cruel and I wonder
If you feel it too, its like were going under.
Somewhere outside the lonely Esmeralda county line,
The question of my heart came to my mind.
If I go on with you (by my side), can it be the way it was when we met?
Did you forget all about those golden nights?
Maybe a thief stole your heart, or maybe we just drifted apart.
I remember driving in my daddys car to the airfield,
Blanket on the hood, backs against the windshield.
Back then this thing was running on momentum, love and trust
That paradise is buried in the dust.
If I go on with you by my side can it be the way it was when we met?
Did you forget all about those golden nights?
(The way it was, it was.)
All of our plans are falling through.
Sometimes a dream, it dont come true.
Darling, darling,
(If we go on can it be)
Can it be the way it was when we met?
Did you forget all about them golden nights?
If I go on with you (by my side) can it be the way it was?
My heart is true, girl, its just you Im thinking of.
Can it be the way it was?
(Maybe a thief stole your heart)
