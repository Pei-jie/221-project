Don't you think that it's boring how people talk
Making smart with the words again
Well I'm bored
Because I'm doing this for the thrill of it
Killing it
Never not chasing a million things I want
And I am only as young as the minute is
Full of it
Getting pumped up on the little bright things I bought
But I know they'll never own me
Baby be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
Its a new art form showing people how little we care
Yeaaaa
We're so happy
Even when we're smiling out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like yeaaa [yeaaa]
Pretty soon I'll be getting on my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city like they do in space
But my head's filling up fast with the wicked games
Up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again when I'm known
And my boys trip me up with their heads again
Loving them
Everythings cool when we're all in line for the throne
But I know it's not forever
Baby be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
Its a new art form showing people how little we care
[Yeaaaa]
We're so happy
Even when we're smiling out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like yeaaa [yeaaa]
It looked alright in the pictures
Getting caught's half of the trip though, isn't it?
I fall apart with all my heart
But you can watch from your window
[Laugh] You can watch from your window
Baby be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care
Yeaaaa
We're so happy
Even when we're smiling out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like yeaaa [yeaaa]
And talk it up like yeaaa [yeaaa]
And talk it up like yeaaa [yeaaa]
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like yeaaa [yeaaa]
And talk it up like yeaaa [yeaaa]
And talk it up like yeaaa [yeaaa]
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like yeaaa [yeaaa]
