Here we lay face to face once again
Silence cuts like a knife as we pretend
And I'm wondering who will be the first to say what we both know
We're just holding on to 'Could Have Been's', and we should be letting go
It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
And I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part but we're just pretending
And I can't hide the tears 'cause even though you're here
Feels like you're a million miles away, way
Was it me, or was it you that broke away?
For what we were is like a seasons love is change
And every time I think about it, it tears me up inside
Like the rivers of emotion but I got no more tears to cry
It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
And I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
We both know that the story's ending
We play the part but we're just pretending
And I can't hide the tears 'cause even though you're here
Feels like you're a million miles away, away
We can try to talk it over but we walked that road before
While our song is playing its last note
And we both know for sure that it's time to close that door
It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
And I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
We both know that the story's ending
We play the part but we're just pretending
And I can't hide the tears 'cause even though you're here
Feels like you're a million miles away
Million miles away
