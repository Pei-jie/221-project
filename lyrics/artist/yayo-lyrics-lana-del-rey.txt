I like the snake on your tattoo
I like the Ivy and the
Ink blue
Yayo, yes you
Yayo
You have to take me right now
From this dark trailer park
Life now
Yayo, how now
Yayo
Put me onto your black motorcycle
Fifty baby doll dress for my 'I do"
It only take two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle
You call me your mama
Let me put on a show for you daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you tiger
Ahhh-ah-ah
Let me put on a show
I need you like
A baby when i hold you
Like a druggy
Like I told you
Yayo, yeah you
Yayo
Put me onto your black motorcycle
Fifties baby doll dress for my 'I do"
It only take two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle
You call me your mama
Let me put on a show for you daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you tiger
Ahhh-ah-ah
Let me put on a show
Hello Heaven
You are a tunnel lined with yellow lights
On a dark night
(Dark night)
Yayo
Yeah you
Yayo
Put me onto your black motorcycle
Fifty baby doll dress for my 'I do"
It only take two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle
You call me your mama
Let me put on a show for you daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you tiger
Let me put on a show
