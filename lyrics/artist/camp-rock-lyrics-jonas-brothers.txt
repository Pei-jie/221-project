We rock, we rock on
We rock, we rock on
Verse 1
Come as you are
You're a superstar
World in your pocket and you know it
You can feel that beat
Running through your feet
Heart's racing fast, you're rock and rolling
All that you need is the music to take you to some other place where You know you belong
Chorus
Raise your hands up in the air and scream
We're finding our voice following our dreams
Cause We rock,
We rock, we rock, we rock on
nobody in the world's gonna bring us down
the louder we go well the better we sound
cause we rock
We rock we rock we rock on
(We rock, we rock, we rock on. We rock, we rock, we rock on.
Verse 2
We're finally letting go, losing all control.
We won't stop ourselves 'cus we love it.
We're not afraid to be everything you see.
No more hiding out we're gonna own it.
All that you need is the music to take you to some other place where you know you belong.
Chorus
Bridge
We got the music in our souls
And it's the thing we want the most
It picks us up when we fall down
And turns our world around
We rock (Camp rock)
We rock, we rock on
Everyday and every night
We rock (Camp rock)
We rock, we rock on
It's all we wanna do in life
Chorus
Raise your hands up in the air and scream
We're finding our voice followin our dreams
Cause we rock
We rock, we rock, we rock on
Nobody in the world's gonna bring us down
The louder we go well the better we sound
Cus we rock
We rock we rock we rock on
