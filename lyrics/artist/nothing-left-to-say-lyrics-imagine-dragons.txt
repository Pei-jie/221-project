Who knows how long I've been awake now
The shadows on my wall don't sleep
They keep calling me
Beckoning
Who knows what's right; the lines keep getting thinner
My age has never made me wise
But I keep pushing on and on and on and on
(ooh)
There's nothing left to say now
(ooh)
There's nothing left to say now
(ooh)
I'm giving up, giving up(hey hey) giving up now
I'm giving up, giving up(hey hey) giving up now
(ooh)
There's nothing left to say now
(ooh)
There's nothing left to say now
(ooh)
I'm giving up, giving up(hey hey) giving up now
I'm giving up, giving up(hey hey) giving up now
Below, my soul, I feel an engine
Collapsing as it sees the pain
If I could only shut it out
I've come, too far, to see the end now
Even if my way is wrong
But I keep pushing on and on and on and on
(ooh)
There's nothing left to say now
(ooh)
There's nothing left to say now
(ooh)
I'm giving up, giving up(hey hey) giving up now
I'm giving up, giving up(hey hey) giving up now
(ooh)
There's nothing left to say now
(ooh)
There's nothing left to say now
(ooh)
I'm giving up, giving up(hey hey) giving up now
I'm giving up, giving up(hey hey) giving up now
I keep falling, I keep falling down
I keep falling, I keep falling down
(hey)
I keep falling, I keep falling down
I keep falling, I keep falling down
If you could only save me
I'm drowning in the waters of my soul
(ooh)
There's nothing left to say now
(ooh)
There's nothing left to say now
(ooh)
I'm giving up, giving up(hey hey) giving up now
I'm giving up, giving up(hey hey) giving up now
(ooh)
There's nothing left to say now
(ooh)
There's nothing left to say now
(ooh)
I'm giving up, giving up(hey hey) giving up now
I'm giving up, giving up(hey hey) giving up now
