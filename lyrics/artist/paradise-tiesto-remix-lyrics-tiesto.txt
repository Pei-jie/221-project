When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
and dreamed of
Para-para-paradise [x3]
Every time she closed her eyes
Oh~ oh~ oh~ oh~ [x4]
In the night, the stormy night
She'll...
Close her eyes~
Flew away~
Goes on
Say "oh"
[Fragments x4]
(Para-para-paradise) [x4]
(Para-para-paradise) [x4]
And dreamed of
Para-para-paradise [x3]
Oh~
Close her eyes~
Flew away~
Goes on
Say "oh"
[Fragments x4]
Para-para-paradise [x3]
Every time she closed her eyes~
