You took your love away too fast
Left no chance to say, look back
And now I know the truth, it makes it easier
Maybe when time goes by, I'll understand
Let's pretend that I moved on
Then I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away, I run away
You threw it all away, so blind
Pushed me far from you in your life
Now I know the tears won't lead to loneliness
Maybe when time goes by, understand
Let's pretend that I moved on
Then I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away, I run away, I run away
I run away
I run away
Let's pretend that I moved on
Then I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away, I run away
Let's pretend that I moved on
Tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
I run away, I run away
Let's pretend that I moved on
Then I'll tell myself that life goes on without you
Open my eyes, look deep inside
