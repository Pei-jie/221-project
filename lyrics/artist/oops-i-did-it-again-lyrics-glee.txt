I think I did it again
I made you believe, we're more than just friends
Oh baby, it might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean, that I'm serious
Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh baby, baby
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
You see my problem is this
I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes they truly exist
I cry watchin the days
Cant you see I'm a fool in so many ways?
Oops! I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops! You think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oops! I did it again to your heart
Got lost in this game, oh baby
Oops! You think that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
Oops! I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops! You think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
Oops! I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops! You think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
