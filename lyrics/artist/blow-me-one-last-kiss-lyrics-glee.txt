[Unique:]
White knuckles
And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
[Marley:]
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
[Unique with Marley:]
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire,
And the burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying,
I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope,
Trying to hold, trying to hold
But there's nothing to grab so I let go
[Marley and Unique:]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of it
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse,
I've had a bad day
You've had a bad day
We've had a bad day
I think that life's too short for this
Want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss
[Unique with Marley:]
I won't miss
All of the fighting that we always did,
Take it in
I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left
[Marley with Unique:]
No more sick whiskey-wish,
No more battles for me
You'll be calling a trick,
Cause you'll no longer sleep
I'll dress nice, I'll look good,
I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh, I'll get drunk,
I'll take somebody home
[Marley:]
I think I finally had enough
[Marley with Unique:]
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of it
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
[Marley and Unique:]
Just when it can't get worse,
I've had a bad day
You've had a bad day
We've had a bad day
[Marley with Unique:]
I think that life's too short for this
Want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss
[Marley:]
Na na na na ([Unique:] Oh) da da da da
[Unique:]
Blow me one last kiss
[Marley:]
Na na na na ([Unique:] Woaah!) da da da da
[Unique:]
Blow me one last kiss
[Marley with Unique:]
I will do what I please,
Anything that I want
I will breathe, I will breathe
I won't worry at all
[Unique with Marley:]
You will pay for your sins,
You'll be sorry my dear
All the lies, all the lies,
[Unique:]
Will be crystal clear ([Marley:] Oh!)
[Marley:]
I think I finally had enough
[Unique:]
I think I maybe think too much
[Marley:]
I think this might be it for us
[Marley and Unique:]
Blow me one last kiss
[Marley:]
You think I'm just too serious
[Unique:]
I think you're full of it
[Marley:]
My head is spinning so
[Marley and Unique:]
Blow me one last kiss
[Unique:]
Just when it can't get worse ([Marley:] Oh)
I've had a bad day ([Marley:] Yeah)
You've had a bad day ([Marley:] Oh)
We've had a bad day
[Marley and Unique:]
I think that life's too short for this
[Unique:]
Want back my ignorance and bliss
[Marley:]
I think I've had enough of this
[Marley and Unique:]
Blow me one last kiss
[Unique:]
Na na na na da da da da
[Marley:]
Na na na na da da da da ([Unique:] Oh)
Na na na na da da da da
[Marley and Unique:]
Blow me one last kiss
[Marley:]
Na na na na da da da da ([Unique:] Oh)
Na na na na da da da da ([Unique:] Oh)
Na na na na da da da da
[Marley and Unique:]
Blow me one last kiss
[Unique:]
Just when it can't get worse,
[Marley and Unique:]
I've had a bad day
You've had a bad day
We've had a bad day
I think that life's too short for this
Want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this
Blow me one last kiss
