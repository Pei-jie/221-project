rock
It's getting close to sundown over the Sierra
Stranded on the heatwave burning with desire
She was on the sidewalk looking for a night light
We talked about the real things
And drove into the fire
Headlights on the highway
The desert wind is howling
Rattlesnakes and romance
Is spilling with the rain
Candy apple red dress
Bleeding when she kissed me
Heaven in a ragtop
Take away my pain
When your chips are down
When your highs are low
Joyride
Move across the night
Like a seperate wind
Pulled up to a motel
"Vacancy" was buzzing
Pink and dirty neon
Settle on the hood
Wrapped her arms around me
Come a little closer
Stumble in the twilight
And fell onto the floor
Loving Mona Lisa
Dreaming of the free world
Lipstick on the nightstand
And demons at the door
When your chips are down
When your highs are low
Joyride
Move across the night
Like a separate wind
When your hopes and dreams
Lose the will to go
Joyride
Reaching for the light
Knowing we can't win
There's something in the distance
A glorious existance
A simple celebration
A place you've never been before
(Won't you kiss me)
Tell me that you want it more
Reaching for the light
knowing we can't win
When your chips are down
When your chips are down
When your highs are low
Joyride
All your hopes and dreams
All you need to know
Joyride
