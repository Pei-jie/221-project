[Chorus]
So you think you know how to love a woman
But I think there's still some things you need to know
So you think you know how to love a woman
Well I feel there's still some things you need to know
And you need to know
[Mary J. Blige]
A woman
She needs more than material things
A woman
Needs so much more than what a man can say
[Beyonce]
A woman
Needs you to make love to her, she needs more than sex
Oh, a real woman needs a real man
That don't talk about it, be about it
Put that work in, still shows his woman real romance
[Chorus]
So you think you know how to love a woman
But I think there's still some things you need to know
So you think you know how to love a woman
But I feel there's still some things you need to know
Things you need to know
[Beyonce]
A woman
She likes to talk, and work it out
A woman
Likes for you to watch her back, protect her crown
[Mary J. Blige]
A woman
dont only want your make up sex
She wants your respect
And a real woman never wanna walk
Into a room, see another woman
Knowing information she don't even know about her man
[Chorus]
So you think you know how to love a woman
But I think there's still some things you need to know
So you think you know how to love a woman
But I feel there's still some things you need to know
that you need to know
[Beyonce and Mary - Bridge]
Make your way home
At a decent hour everynight
pick up your phone
Just to say you're still in love from time to time
Remind her, that she's still beautiful in your eyes
And ride with your woman,
Make her feel that you're always on her side
When she cries,
Ask her what she's feeling
Let her know you sympathize
Gotta swallow your pride
Got some making up to do, gotta make it right
Kiss her real slow and get down and blow her mind
Got to take your time
I say, Kiss her real slow and get down and blow her mind
Say it one more time, Say it one more time
Kiss her real slow and get down and blow her mind
Got to take your time
Don't no want minute man
We wanna have fun til she finish man
But that's asking too much
You never know how to be
Love a woman
[Chorus]
Boy you think you know how to love a woman
But I think there's still some things you need to know
So you think you know how to love a woman
But I think there's still some things you need to know
Things you need to know
You think you know how to love a woman
