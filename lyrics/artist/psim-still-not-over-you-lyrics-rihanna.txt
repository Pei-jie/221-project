What's up? I know we haven't spoken for a while
But I was thinking 'bout you and it kinda made me smile
So many things to say and I'll put 'em in a letter
Thought it might be easier the words might come out better
How's your mother, how's your little brother?
Does he still look just like you?
So many things I wanna know the answers to
Wish I could press rewind and rewrite every line
To the story of me and you
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind
But it don't get no better as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S. I'm still not over you, you, you
(Still not over you)
Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on
But there's a lot of feelings that remain since you've been gone
I guess you thought that I would've put it all behind me
But it seems there's always something right there to remind me
Like a silly joke or something on the TV, boy, it ain't easy
When I hear our song I get that same old feeling
Wish I could press rewind, turn back the hands of time
And I shouldn't be telling you, you
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind
But it don't get no better as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S. I'm still not over you, you, you
(Still not over you)
Did you know I kept all of your pictures
Don't have the strength to part with them yet, oh no
Tried to erase the way your kisses taste
But some things a girl can never forget
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind
But it don't get no better as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S. I'm still not over you, oh
(Still not over you)
You know how I tried to forget you
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind
But it don't get no better as each day goes by
(Don't get no better as each day goes by)
And I'm lost and confused I've got nothin' to lose
(Still not over you)
