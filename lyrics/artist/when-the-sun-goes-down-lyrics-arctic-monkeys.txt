So who's that girl there?
I wonder what went wrong
So that she had to roam the streets
She don't do major credit cards
I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate
And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I'll bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes
Yeah that he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offenses
And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
'Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know
I said he's a scumbag, don't you know!
Although you're trying not to listen
Avert your eyes and staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
I'm sorry love I'll have to turn you down
He must be up to something
What are the chances? Sure its more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
I start to wonder what his story might be
What his story might be
They said it changes when the sun goes down
They said it changes when the sun goes down
They said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here, around here
Look here comes a Ford Mondeo
Isn't he Mister Inconspicuous?
And he don't even have to say 'owt
Shes in the stance ready to get picked up
Bet she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
It doesn't stop in the winter, no
They said it changes when the sun goes down
They said it changes when the sun goes down
They said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
They said it changes when the sun goes down
Over the river going out of town
They said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here, around here
And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes yeah that he's got a nasty plan
I hope you're not involved at all
