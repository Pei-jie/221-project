[Verse 1]
I'm a red and fragile rose, won't grow in the dark alone
Take me there 'coz I need to find the light
I hate that I'm scared of this, but you believe so I'll take the risk
Hold me and tell me I'm alright
[Pre 1]
Now I'm falling down, you lift me up to the clouds
Yes I'm falling down, you lift me up (yeah)
[Chorus 1]
You make my hands shake, I watch the glass break
Around my guarded heart tonight
This ain't no mistake, you make my earth quake
You feel like thunder in the sky
Like thunder thunder thunder, oh oh
Thunder thunder thunder
Like thunder thunder thunder, o oh oh
You feel like thunder in the sky
[Verse 2]
Broke free saw an open road, footsteps lead me to your soul
Now I run with a home to go to
Never thought I'd be this happy, if you're asking yes you have me
How you changed my thoughts, you'll never know
[Pre 2]
So when you're falling down, I'll lift you up to the clouds
Yes when you're falling down, I'll lift you up (yeah)
[Chorus 2]
You make my hands shake, I watch the glass break
Around my guarded heart tonight
This ain't no mistake, you make my earth quake
You feel like thunder in the sky
Like thunder thunder thunder, oh oh
Thunder thunder thunder
Like thunder thunder thunder, o oh oh
You feel like thunder in the sky
[Bridge 1]
I was broken and staring to think that I should be ashamed, trembling and nervous and naked feeling afraid
Then you came and told me and showed me to fight through the rain
Fight through the rain, to fight through the rain
(yeah yeah yeah yeah)
[Chorus 3]
You make my hands shake, I watch the glass break
Around my guarded heart tonight
This ain't no mistake, you make my earth quake
You feel like thunder in the sky
Like thunder thunder thunder, oh oh
Thunder thunder thunder
Like thunder thunder thunder, o oh oh
You feel like thunder in the sky
