He put it on me, I put it on
Like there was nothin' wrong
It didn't fit, it wasn't right
Wasn't just the size
They say you know when you know
I don't know
I didn't feel
The fairy tale feeling, no
Am I a stupid girl
For even dreaming that I could?
If it's not like the movies
That's how it should be
When he's the one, I'll come undone
And my world will stop spinning
And that's just the beginning
Snow White said when I was young
One day, my prince will come so I'll wait for that date
They say it's hard to meet your match
Gotta find my better half so we make perfect shapes
If stars don't align, if it doesn't stop time
If you can't see the sign, wait for it
One-hundred percent, worth every penny you spend
He'll be the one that finishes your sentences
If it's not like the movies
That's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one, I'll come undone
And my world will stop spinning
And that's just the beginning
'Cause I know you're out there
And you're, you're lookin' for me
It's a crazy idea that
You were made perfectly for me, you see
Just like the movies
That's how it will be
Cinematic and dramatic
With the perfect ending
It's not like the movies
But that's how it should be
When he's the one, you'll come undone
And your world will stop spinning
And it's just the beginning
