I'm tuggin' at my hair, I'm pullin' at my clothes
I'm tryin' to keep my cool, I know it shows
I'm starin' at my feet, my cheeks are turnin' red
I'm searchin' for the words inside my head
I'm feelin' nervous
Tryin' to be so perfect
'Cause I know you're worth it
You're worth it, yeah
If I could say what I want to say
I say I wanna blow you away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight?
If I could say what I want to see
I want to see you go down on one knee
Marry me today
Guess I'm wishin' my life away
With these things I'll never say
It don't do me any good, it's just a waste of time
What use is it to you what's on my mind?
If it ain't comin' out, we're not goin' anywhere
So why can't I just tell you that I care?
'Cause I'm feelin' nervous
Tryin' to be so perfect
'Cause I know you're worth it
You're worth it, yeah
If I could say what I want to say
I say I wanna blow you away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight?
If I could say what I want to see
I want to see you go down on one knee
Marry me today
Yes, I'm wishing my life away
And these things I'll never say
What is wrong with my tongue?
These words keep slippin' away
I stutter, I stumble
Like I've got nothin' to say
'Cause I'm feelin' nervous
Tryin' to be so perfect
'Cause I know you're worth it
You're worth it, yeah
Yes, I'm wishing my life away
But these things I'll never say
If I could say what I want to say
I say I wanna blow you away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight?
If I could say what I want to see
I want to see you go down on one knee
Marry me today
Yes, I'm wishing my life away
But these things I'll never say
These things I'll never say
