Reign of love I cant let go
To the sea I offer this heavy load
Locusts will lift me up
Im just a prisoner in a reign of love
Locusts will let us stop
I wish I'd spoken to the reign of love
Reign of love, by the church, were waiting
Reign of love, my knees go praying
How I wish I'd spoken up
Or we get carried on a reign of love
