Paramore
rock
I climb, I slip, I fall
Reaching for your hands
But I lay here all alone
Sweating all your blood
If I could find out how
To make you listen now
Because I'm starving for you here
With my undying love and I, I will
Breathe for love tomorrow
'Cause there's no hope for today
Breathe for love tomorrow
'Cause maybe there's another way
I climb, I slip, I fall
Reaching for your hands
But I lay here all alone
Sweating all your blood
If I could find out how
To make you listen now
Because I'm starving for you here
With my undying love and I, I will
Breathe for love tomorrow
'Cause there's no hope for today
Breathe for love tomorrow
'Cause maybe there's another way
Breathe for love tomorrow
'Cause there's no hope for today
Breathe for love tomorrow
'Cause maybe there's another way
I climb, I slip, I fall
Reaching for your hands
But I lay here all alone
Sweating all your blood
