rock
Hha ah ha ah ha ah ha ah
Mary, if you want to
I waive my right
I'll be on the corner
Just passin' time
No I won't, ever once, make you cry i hi hi
Just a kiss, oh I miss your goodbye i hi hi hi hi hi
ha ah ha ah ha ah ha ah
We'll go to the disco
We'll be a sight
Oh & we'll dance like (we're) boyfriends
It's sheer delight
No I won't, never once, make you cry i hi hi
With a kiss, how I miss your goodbye
No I won't, never once, make you cry hi hi hi
Just to kiss, oh and I'll miss your goodbye i hi hi hi hi hi
ha ah (repeated)
