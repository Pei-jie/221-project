I killed my former and left her in the trunk on highway 10
put the knife under the hood,
if you find it send it straight to Hollywood.

I'm not a wandering slave, I am a woman of choice.
My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face.
You ought to pity me 'cause there's always one man to love.
But in the bedroom the size of him's more than enough.
Do you wanna see me naked lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura?
Do you wanna touch me cosmic lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura?
Behind the aura?
Behind the aura?
Enigma popstar is fun, she wears burqa for fashion.
It's not a statement as much as just a move of passion.
I may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil.
I hear you screaming is it because of pleasure or toil?
