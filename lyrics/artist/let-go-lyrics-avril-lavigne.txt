Hey, yeah, oh, oh
Hey, yeah, oh, oh
Hey, yeah, oh, oh
Ive only got three dollars left in my hands
I walk down the sidewalk as I pass a dirty man
Walk up the staircase that leads to my hotel
Im living in at a fancy hotel, yeah, yeah
Then Ill go up to my room
Fixate on whats the deal, Im alone again
Then I will crawl into the bed
And call you up to tell you off
'Cause Im on my own
Would you leave me alone
Before I lose my mind
Because you lied and so did I
Oh, oh oh, would you cry
If I let you go tonight
If I let you go tonight
Yeah, yeah, let go
Hey, yeah, oh, oh
Ill probably wake up a little sad
But then Ill get up and let go of it all instead
Because really its not worth it
To get in a mess over him
To bother get stressed over him
So Ill just go on with my life
And fixate on everything else but you
Yeah, Ill just go on with my life
I have no reason to please you anymore
'Cause Im on my own
Would you leave me alone
Before I lose my mind
Because you lied and so did I
Oh, oh, oh, would you cry
If I let you go tonight if I let you go
So find your way out of my sight
I know its hard, its tough to laugh
Its all messed up, dont play this game
'Cause Im on my own
Would you leave me alone
Before I lose my mind
Because you lied and so did I
Oh, oh oh, would you cry
If I let you go tonight
If I let you go tonight
Yeah, yeah, let go
'Cause Im on my own
Would you leave me alone
Before I lose my mind
Because you lied and so did I
Oh, oh oh, would you cry
If I let you go tonight
If I let you go tonight
Yeah, yeah, let go
Yeah, yeah
Getting stressed over you
Getting messed over you
