Oh ohh oh ohh
When I was just a little boy
barely strong enough to stand
I could always count on him
he taught me everything I know
and till this day it shows
he was more than just a friend
there was so many times I would doubt myself
but his words were always there to help
i wouldn't be
where i am
if my father didn't tell me
to never say i can't
he'd carry me
and never let me fall
and the only thing he asked
right before he passed
was to never say you can't
ohh no ohh ohh
so when lifes rain begins to fall
and youre out there on your own
and you cant see a thing
just find that voice that understands
for me it was my old man
he taught me to say the words I can
oh
there was so many times I would doubt myself
but his words were always there to help
I wouldn't be where I am
if my father didn't tell me to never say I can't
he'd carry me
and never let me fall
oh and they only thing he asked
right before he passed
was to never say you can't
everything you taught me will stay with me forever
no I wont forget a thing
oh because of my dad I now know myself better
and I hope i can do for him what he did for me
I wouldnt be where I am
if my father didnt tell me
to never say I cant
oh he'd carry
and never let me fall
oh and they only thing he asked
right before he passed
was to never say you cant
oh never say you can't (x2)
