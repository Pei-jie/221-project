Confidence is a must
Happiness is a plus
Edginess is a rush
Edges I like them rough
A man with a midas touch
Intoxicate me, I'm a rush
Stop, you're making me blush
People are looking at us
I don't think you know, know
I'm checking you so hot, so hot
Wonder if he knows, he's on my radar
On my radar, on my radar, on my radar
And if I notice you, I know it's you
Choosing, don't wanna losing you
On my radar, on my radar
On my radar, on my radar
And when you walk
(When you walk)
And when you talk
(When you talk)
I get the tingle
I wanna mingle
That's what I want
(That's what I want)
And listen baby, turn up the fader
Trying to make you understand
You're on my radar, on my radar
On my radar, on my radar, on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Interesting sense of style
Ten million dollar smile
Think I can handle that
Animal in the sack
His eyes see right to my soul
I saw and lose self-control
Catch me looking again
Falling right into my plan
I don't think you know, know
I'm checking you, so hot, so hot
Wonder if he knows, he's on my radar
On my radar, on my radar, on my radar
And if I notice you, I know it's you
Choosing, don't wanna losing you
On my radar, on my radar
On my radar, on my radar
When you walk
(When you walk)
And when you talk
(When you talk)
I get the tingle
I wanna mingle
That's what I want
(That's what I want)
And listen baby turn up the fader
Trying to make you understand
You're on my radar, on my radar
On my radar, on my radar
On my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
On my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
I got my eye on you
And I can't let you get away
Hey baby, whether it's now or later
I've got you
You can't shake me
'Cause I got you on my radar
Whether you like it or not, it ain't gonna stop
'Cause I got you on my radar
(I got you)
'Cause I got you on my radar
I'm checking you, so hot, so hot
Wonder if he knows, he's on my radar
On my radar, on my radar, on my radar
And if I notice you, I know it's you
Choosing, don't wanna losing you
On my radar, on my radar
On my radar, on my radar
When you walk
(When you walk)
And when you talk
(When you talk)
I get the tingle
I wanna mingle
That's what I want
(That's what I want)
And listen baby, turn up the fader
Trying to make you understand
You're on my radar, on my radar
On my radar, on my radar
On my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
On my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
Got you on my radar
