Pitbull
pop
What would the music be without the sounds?
Young Boss, Miss Trina, Pitbull
Let's show 'em how we get down
I party like a rock star
Look like a movie star
Play like an all-star
Fuck like a porn star
Baby, I'm a superstar
Always posted at the bar
Always with a couple broads
Maybe I'm just that, that raw
Dawg, check your resume
I hit somethin every day
Ask about me and they'll say
That chico run MIA
Pitbull, Young Boss, thats fire
Go girl, work it out til you tired
Just tryin to pay tuition? Liar

And, baby, don't say no names
And we can do this one more again
