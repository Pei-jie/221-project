The song is dedicated to true love
Yes, that's right
Sunrise, joy, sun shines
Eagles soar, flowers in the meadow
Warriors ride to loved ones
Wish you were here
My dear, my Janym.
I will be with you
Janym, my dear
I will always wait for you
Janym, together we walk
Until the bazaar in Osh
I can hear your sweet voice
I feel joy in my heart
I'll save you my princess
be together forever
My dear, my Janym
I will be with you
Janym, my dear
I will always wait for you
Janym, together we walk
Until the bazaar in Osh
But even the smallest stone
Can be stronger than a mountain
Love's mighty power
Is stronger than hate
Janym, my dear
I will always wait for you
Janym, together we walk
Until the bazaar in Osh
