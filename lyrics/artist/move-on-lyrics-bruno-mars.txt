How do I end up in the same old place
Faced again with the same mistakes
So stubborn, thinking I know what is right
But life proves me wrong every time
Taking roads that lead me no where,
How do I expect to get there
But when will I learn to just put you first
I come to you now when I need you
But why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong, cause only with you
Can I move on (can I move on)
When I'm weak, it's you that makes me strong
And I know that you've been with me all along
So many times I forget to close my eyes
And listen to my heart
With you, life is so easy
Why do I make it hard
Oh, taking roads that lead me no where,
How do I expect to get there
When will I learn to just put you first
I, I come to you now when I need you
But why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong, cause only with you
Can I move on
I'll get out of my own way,
Let you have your way
Cause I realized I'm no good on my own
I'm there for you, I'll serve for you
I can't live without you
I come to you now when I need you
Why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong,
With only you, only you, with only you
Can I move on, can I move on, can I move on
