rock
I was running through the desert, I was looking for drugs
And I was searching for a woman who was willing to love
So I could take her like a woman
Yeah take her like a woman
I was looking for a bad girl, looking for a bad boy
Someone who could take all the night away
Oh baby I could shake it like a woman
Yeah shake it like a woman
I got the eyes on me
Of a jealous man, and if you're looking to run, well then you've already ran
I break down like a woman
I break down like a woman
I'll go back to Rock City,
That's where she saw me
Everybody's seen her, everyone believes me
I've been several miles and plenty more,
And I found myself face-first on the floor
Searching for something
But never finding something
And I don't know where I belong,
I'm just trying to get myself back home
And get a little work
Yeah find my little woman
And I'll go back to Rock City
That's where she saw me
Everybody's seen her, everyone believes me
Oh my my, oh my my, oh my my
I need to find something
I'm searching for something
I'll go back to Rock City
That's where she saw me
Everybody's seen her, everyone believes me
I'll go back to Rock City,
That's where she saw me
Everybody's seen her, everyone believes me
