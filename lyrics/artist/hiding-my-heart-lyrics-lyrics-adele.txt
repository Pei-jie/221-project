This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
Who blew me away, blew me away
It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, buried them away
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
Drop off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave, you watched you wave
Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
Neon lights and waiting papers
That Icall home, I call that home
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I woke up feeling heavy hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, morning rain
Although I wish that you were here
That same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, it's calling me home
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known, you disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away
