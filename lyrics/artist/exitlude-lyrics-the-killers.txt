Aggressively, we all defend the role we play
Regrettably, times come to send you on your way
We've seen it all, bonfires of trust, flash floods of pain
It doesnt really matter, dont you worry, itll all work out
No, it doesn't even matter, don't you worry,
That ain't what it's all about
We hope, you enjoyed your stay
Its good to have you with us, even if its just for the day
We hope, you enjoyed your stay
Outside the sun is shining, seems like heaven aint far away
Its good to have you with us, even if its just for the day
Its good to have you with us, even if its just for the day
Outside the sun is shining, seems like heaven aint far away
Its good to have you with us, even if its just for the day
Outside the sun is shining, seems like heaven aint far away
Seems like heaven aint far away
