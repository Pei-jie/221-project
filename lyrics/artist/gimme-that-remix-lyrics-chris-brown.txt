What it is folk?
This right here is the 16-year-old phenom Chris Breezy
Me myself I'm the 23-year-old CEO, who?
Young Carter, harder than them other boys
I ain't even frontin' baby, I could take a summer off
I could break a woman off, I could take the stomach off
One of my trucks, now I'm ridin' in the goods
Line it on up, guarantee you'll get served
Lil' Chris said, Run It, so I run it to her
I'm that cash money young'n, Birdman Jr.
Just a president lookin' for a Monica
The young boy just turned 16
And I got 64's and hot bikes that I rock
Keep 3 or 4 sweeties on my clock
But all that swinging in that bikini just make 'em vicious
Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop
'Cause you speaking that slang that I talk
That sassy tempo with that walk
May be the reason that all these teenies may never see me
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot
(Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got
(Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac,
You could be in the back saying gimme gimme, gimme
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot
(Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got
(Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme gimme, gimme
Ma, take a break, let me explain to you
What ya body got a young boy ready to do
If you take a chance to let me put them things on you
I could show you why I make them straight A's in school
I'm a hustla, trust my frame and age
Got you thinking that I'm just too young to turn your page
I can picture us switching lanes in the coupe
With you on the phone screaming my name
(Chris!)
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot
(Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got
(Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme gimme, gimme
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot
(Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got
(Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme gimme, gimme
Woo womp, womp, woo womp, womp
Woo womp, woo womp
Girl you serious and I been watching you
Woo womp, womp, woo womp, womp
Woo womp, woo womp
This' what your body's saying
Woo womp, womp, woo womp, womp
Woo womp, woo womp
(Yeah)
Woo womp, womp, woo womp, womp
Woo womp, woo womp
Get em
Ok, Weezy baby baby what it do? I'm tryna holla at you
I ain't upset, but I'd blind you if I smile at you
You rockin' with young Chris and the best rapper
So leave your phone, bring your friends, let the rest happen
A lil' Patrone, lil' henna, I'm on Cavalli vodka
I'm in Cavalli jeans, got on Cavalli boxas
I`m fresha than a new born and um, I could work you out like a futon
And um, you could leave your birthday suit on
I'ma leave my boots on, I'ma leave my jewels on
Neva know what you want, I'ma leave that tool on
Never know who home I learned that from a biggie song
Onto a new one, something like a red bone
Ooo I think she like me, she got me on her ringtone
And I told her get your girl and don't you stunt
Now gimme that funk, that gushy stuff
Oh
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot
(Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got
(Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme gimme, gimme
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot
(Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got
(Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme gimme, gimme

Aight? Yeah
