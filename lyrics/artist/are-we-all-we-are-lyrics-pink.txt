Ohhh
Ohhh
Are we all we are
Are we all we are
Cut to now, holy wow
When did everything become such a hell of a mess
Maybe now maybe now
Can somebody come and take this off my chest
I know you think it's not your problem
I know you think that God will solve them
But if your sh-t is not together
It'll never be you and me, plant the seed
Open up and let it be
We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of, ohhh
We've had our fill, we've had enough, we've had it up to here
Are we all we are
Are we all we are
We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of, ohhh
Just sing it loud, until the kids will sing it right back
Are we all we are
Are we all we are
Ohhh
Ohhh
Are we all we are
Are we all we are
Seven seconds, seven seconds
That is all the time you got to make your point
My attention, my attention's
Like an infant trying to crawl around this joint
I know we're better than the masses
But we're all following with our asses
And if our sh-t is not together
It'll never be you and me, plant the seed
Open up and let it be
We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of, ohhh
We've had our fill, we've had enough, we've had it up to here
Are we all we are
Are we all we are
We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of, ohhh
Just sing it loud, until the kids will sing it right back
Are we all we are
Are we all we are
Four, that's how many years it took me to get through the lesson that I had to do it all on my own
Three, that's how many hail mary's they would pray for me thinking I was gonna end up all alone
Two for second chances that you've given me, can it be?
Lucky me lucky me, now let's go
One it's what we are, it's what we are
Are we all we are
Are we all we are
We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of, ohhh
We've had our fill, we've had enough, we've had it up to here
Are we all we are
Are we all we are
We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of, ohhh
Just sing it loud, until the kids will sing it right back
Are we all we are
Are we all we are
We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of, ohhh
We've had our fill, we've had enough, we've had it up to here
Are we all we are
Are we all we are
We are the people that you'll never get the best of
Not forget the rest of, rest of, ohhh
Cut the future, sing it out, and take the power back
Are we all we are
Are we all we are
