Then there was rain
The sky wore a veil of gold and gray
At night it was the bright of the moon with me
Time just floating
Then there was rain
The sound foundations are crumbling
To the ground comes a bit of a-tumbling
And time just floated away
We watch it and stay and we can listen
Oh rainy day, come 'round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
And we're separated now, I'm down
But I love when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house
Then there was rain
And I spent the night with the Queen of Spain
My lonely little heart would've broke again
Time's still vicious
So when the deeper that the knife goes in
The more you win
You win but with less than when you begin
The deeper that the knife goes in, ohh
Oh rainy day, come 'round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
And we're separated now, I'm down
But I love when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house, oh, oh, oh
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house
I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house
