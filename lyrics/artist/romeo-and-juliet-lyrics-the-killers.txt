A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
He finds a streetlight and he steps out of the shade
And says something like, You and me babe, how about it?
Juliet says, Hey, its Romeo, you nearly gave me a heart attack
Hes underneath the window, shes singing, Hey la my boyfriends back
You shouldnt come around here singing up at people like that
Anyway what you gonna do about it?
Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
And I bet and you exploded in my heart
And I forget, I forget the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong? Juliet
Come up on different streets and both were streets of shame
Both dirty, both mean, yes, and the dream was just the same
Then I dream your dream for you, now your dream is real
How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?
You can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin, yeah
Now you just say, "Oh Romeo, yeah
You know I used to have a scene with him"
Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
I said I love you like the stars above, Ill love you till I die
And theres a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong? Juliet
I cant do the talk like the talk on the TV
And I cant do a love song like the way its meant to be
I cant do everything but Id do anything for you
I cant do anything except be in love with you
And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be
And all I do is keep the beat, the bad company
And all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
Juliet, Id do the stars with you any time
Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
I said I love you like the stars above, Ill love you till I die
And theres a place for us, you know the movie song
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong? Juliet
And a lovestruck Romeo, sings the streets a serenade
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
He finds a convenient streetlight and steps out of the shade
And says something like, You and me babe, how about it?
