Gesundheit.
Tonight we're celebrating our 100th short. So come with us, won't you?
-Let's Celebrate!-
Congratulations!
To us, to us
Truly a major milestone
A celebration! (Yes!)
Of us, of us
Here's what we're going to do
Gonna shake off the cobwebs and limber up
And stretch it out and do plenty of Pilates
'Cause tonight, tonight we're gonna suck our own d**ks
Wait, what?
What?
That's disgusting!
No, it's not.
Hey, look, it's Shy Ronnie and Reba!
It's a celebration and we're going to party
Y'know we getting naughty
Take it Shy Ronnie
(mumbling)
I'm a dude
Ronnie, bitch, and I rip you ass open!
We've done the creep and punched people before
eating
We've done things in our pants that don't bear repeating
Tonight, they're gonna suck their own d**k
I'm Reba!
Excuse I!
What is happening?
So shoot your laser cats and let the boombox pound
Raise up our glasses and...
Throw it on the ground!
Alcohol is poison, man!
Take it Mahmoud
Body Fuzion lady
(It aint over)
We put our junk in so many places
(Like where)
Each other's mothers and these floral vases
(For sale)
And now they're takin' them out of their boxes
(Yeah)
And puttin' them all up into our Faces
(Let's go)

Show my ass respect
But I make that f***ing gravy!

Three 'Best Of's- count 'em bitch
Get out of here
Fine! I'll go by my own choice
