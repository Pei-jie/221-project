I've hoped for change and it gets better everyday
I've hoped for change but still I feel the same
There's something wrong 'cause everybody knows
That we can do this on our own
And we've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We're doing fine and it gets better every time
We're doing fine but I'll let you decide
There's something wrong 'cause everybody knows
That we can do this on our own
And we've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
And I'll confess that I can be a little selfish
Yeah, I'll admit
I don't want you to help me through this
I don't want to start over again
And we've got everybody singing
And we've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
And we've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
And I'll confess that I can be a little selfish
I can, I can, yeah, I'll admit
I don't want you to get me through this
I don't want to start over again
