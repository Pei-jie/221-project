I could have all the money
All the fancy treasures in the world
25 Vegas just to hold my diamonds and my pearls
I know its a fantasy
Nothing like I wanna be
Baby you and me that's real
Something like a masterpiece
Would be up on galleries
You and I, that's real
If I had everything
It wouldn't mean a thing
'Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you
No matter what they say, can't take my love away
'Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you
Baby even when we're miles apart
You'll always stay inside my heart
Let me tell you no one else will do
'Cause baby nothing feels like you
Boys will be boys
I got plenty knocking on my door
But none of them compares baby
You're the one I'm waiting for
Cause I'm living in a fantasy
Every time you're here with me
Kiss me if its real
Baby you were meant to keep
You bring out the best in me
Now I know it's real
If I had everything
It wouldn't mean a thing
'Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you
No matter what they say, can't take my love away
'Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you
Baby even when we're miles apart
You'll always stay inside my heart
Let me tell you no one else will do
'Cause baby nothing feels like you
No nothing like it
No nothing like
No nothing like it
No nothing like
If I had everything
It wouldn't mean a thing
'Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you
No matter what they say, can't take my love away
'Cause nothing feels like, nothing feels like you
Baby even when we're miles apart
You'll always stay inside my heart
Let me tell you no one else will do
'Cause baby nothing feels like you
