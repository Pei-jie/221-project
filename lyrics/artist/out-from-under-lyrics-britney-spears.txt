Breathe you out, breathe you in
You keep coming back to tell me
You're the one who could've been
And my eyes see it all so clear
It was long ago and far away
But it never disappears
Try to put it in the past
Hold on to myself and don't look back
I don't wanna dream about all the things that never were
Maybe I can live without, when I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain, what good would it do me now?
I'll get it all figured out, when I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under)
So let me go, just let me fly away
Let me feel the space between us growin' deeper
And much darker every day
Watch me now and I'll be someone new
My heart will be unbroken
It will open up for everyone but you
Even when I cross the line
It's like a lie I've told a thousand times
I don't wanna dream about all the things that never were
Maybe I can live without, when I'm out from under
I don't wanna feel the pain, what good would it do me now?
I'll get it all figured out, when I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under, from under)
A part of me still believes when you say you're gonna stick around
A part of me still believes we can find a way to work it out
But I know that we tried everything we could try
So let's just say goodbye forever
I don't wanna dream about all the things that never were
And maybe I can live without, when I'm out from under
And I don't wanna feel the pain, what good would it do me now?
I'll get it all figured out when I'm out from under
I don't wanna dream about all the things that never were
And maybe I can live without, when I'm out from under
And I don't wanna feel the pain, what good would it do me now?
I'll get it all figured out, when I'm out from under
(From under, from under, from under, from under)
