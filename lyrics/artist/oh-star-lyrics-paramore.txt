Paramore
rock
Oh, star fall down on me
Let me make a wish upon you
Hold on, let me think
Think of what I'm wishing for
Wait, don't go away
Just not yet
'Cause I thought I had it
But I forget
And I won't let you fall away from me
You will never fade
And I won't let you fall away from me
You will never fade away from me
And now I let my dreams consume me
And tell me what to think
But hold on, hold on.
What am I dreaming?
Wait, don't go away
Just not yet.
'Cause I thought that I had it
But I forget
And I won't let you fall away from me
You will never fade away
I won't let you fall away
You will never fade away
And I won't let you fall away
You will never fade away
And I won't let you fall away from me
You will never fade [unverified]
Oh, star fall down on me
