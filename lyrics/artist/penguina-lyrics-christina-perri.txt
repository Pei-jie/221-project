Can you find the time to let your lover love you?
He only wants to show you
The things he wants to learn too
The hardest parts you'll get through
And in the end you'll have your best friend.
Love like this may come once
Baby, it's fate
Like a soul-mate, he's your Penguin
Baby, it's fate
Baby, it's fate
Not luck
Can you find the time to let your lover hold you?
He needs somebody to hold too
His love is strong and so true
His arrow's aiming for you
And he's the one that you were born to love
Love like this may come once
Baby, it's fate
Like a soul-mate, he's your Penguin
Baby, it's fate
Baby, it's fate
Not luck
Let go
Let go of time for you and I
(repeat x2)
Love like this is all I want
Baby, we're fate
Love like this may come once
Baby, we're fate
Like a soul-mate, you're my Penguin
Baby, we're fate
Baby, it's fate
Not luck
