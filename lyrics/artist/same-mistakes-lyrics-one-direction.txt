Circles, we're going in circles
Dizzy's all it makes us
We know where it takes us
We've been before
Closer, maybe looking closer
There's more to discover
Find out what went wrong
Without blaming each other
Think that we got more time
When we're falling behind
Gotta make up my mind
Or else we'll play, play, play all the same old games
And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change
And we take, take, take it for granted that we'll be the same
But we're making all the same mistakes
Wake up, we both need to wake up
Maybe if we face up to this
We can make it through this
Closer, maybe we'll be closer
Stronger than we were before, yeah
Make this something more, yeah
Think that we got more time
One more falling behind
Gotta make up our minds
Or else we'll play, play, play all the same old games
And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change
And we take, take, take it for granted that we'll be the same
But we're making all the same mistakes
Yeah, yeah, that's what crazy is
When it's broken, you say there's nothing to fix
And you pray, pray, pray
That everything will be okay
While you're making all the same mistakes
Don't look back,
But if we don't look back
We're only learning then
How to make all the same, same mistakes again
So we play, play, play all the same old games
And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change
And we take, take, take it for granted that we'll be the same
But we're making all the same mistakes
Yeah, yeah, that's what crazy is
When it's broken, you say there's nothing to fix
And you pray, pray, pray
That everything will be okay
While you`re making all the same mistakes.
