Elvis is my daddy, Marilyns my mother,
Jesus is my bestest friend.
We dont need nobody, cause we got each other,
Or at least I pretend.
We get down every Friday night,
Dancing and grinding in the pale moonlight.
Grand Ole Opry, we're feeling alright,
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind.
(She said don't worry 'bout it.)
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric.
Sing that body electric,
Sing that body electric.
Im on fire, sing that body electric.
Whitman is my daddy, Monacos my mother,
Diamonds are my bestest friend.
Heaven is my baby, suicides her father,
Opulence is the end.
We get down every Friday night,
Dancing and grinding in the pale moonlight.
Grand Ole Opry, we're feeling alright,
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind.
(She said don't worry 'bout it.)
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric.
Sing that body electric,
Sing that body electric.
Im on fire, sing that body electric.
My clothes still smell like you,
And all the photographs say you're still young.
I pretend Im not hurt,
And go about the world like Im havin fun.
We get crazy every Friday night,
Drop it like its hot in the pale moonlight.
Grand Ole Opry, feelin' alright,
Marys swayin softly, to her heart's delight.
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric.
Sing that body electric,
Sing that body electric.
Im on fire, sing that body electric.
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric, baby.
