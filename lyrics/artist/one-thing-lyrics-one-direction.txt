[LIAM PAYNE:]
I've tried playing it cool
Girl when I'm looking at you
I can't ever be brave
'Cause you make my heart race
[HARRY STYLES:]
Shot me out of the sky
You're my kryptonite
You keep making me weak
Yeah, frozen and can't breathe
[ZAYN MALIK:]
Something's gotta give now
Cause I'm dying just to make you see
That I need you here with me now
Cause you've got that one thing
[EVERYONE:]
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing
[NIALL HORAN:]
Now I'm climbing the walls
But you don't notice at all
That I'm going out of my mind
All day and all night
[LOUIS TOMLINSON & ZAYN MALIK IN BACKGROUND:]
Somethings' gotta give now
Cause I'm dying just to know your name
And I need you here with me now
Cause you've got that one thing
[EVERYONE:]
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
[EVERYONE:]
Get out, get out, get out of my mind
And come on, come into my life
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing
[EVERYONE:]
Woah (Clapping)
[HARRY STYLES:]
You've got that one thing
[LIAM PAYNE:]
Get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
[EVERYONE:]
So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
[EVERYONE:]
Get out, get out, get out of my mind
And come on, come into my life
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing
