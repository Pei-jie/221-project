Every day I wake up next to an angel
More beautiful than words could say
They say it wouldn't work, but what did they know?
'Cause years have passed, but we still here today
Never in my dreams,
did I think that this would happen to me?
As I stand here before my woman
I cant fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh, how could I be so lucky?
I must have done something right
And I promise to love her
for the rest of my life
It seems like yesterday when she first said 'hello!'
Funny how time flies by when you're in love
It took us a lifetime to find each other
It was worth the wait cause I finally found the one
Never in my dreams,
did I think that this would happen to me?
As I stand here before my woman
I cant fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh, how could I be so lucky?
I must have done something right
And I promise to love her
for the rest of my life
