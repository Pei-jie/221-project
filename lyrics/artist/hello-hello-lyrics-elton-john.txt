rock
Feel a feeling light
Headed out to see the sights
Ain't life a many splendored thing?
Duckin' up and out
All those crazy sights and sounds
Bounce around like puppets on a string
Never gonna find
Anything to change my mind
Famous last lines of a fool
Just when do you think
You're a chain with just one link
Something comes to tip you off your stool
Hello, hello
My, my, my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise
Hello, hello
I'm not alone, it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello
Do a dizzy dance
Twirl around and take a chance
Nothing's easy, nothing comes for free
Sniffing all the flowers
Running through an autumn shower
Compare it to someone else like me
Hello, hello
My, my, my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise
Hello, hello
I'm not alone, it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello
And I can fly on the back of a bird
And I can shake all leaves from a tree
If there's a quest of a knight, I'll just follow right
Do this better than the one I used to be
Hello, hello
My, my, my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise
Hello, hello
I'm not alone, it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
(Hello)
Hello, hello
My, my, my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise
Hello, hello
I'm not alone, it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
(Hello)
Hello
(Hello)
Hello
Hello, hello
