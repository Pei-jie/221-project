What am I supposed to do with this time?
It tears so many holes, I stay afloat but I'm
Feel out of control, so petrified
I'm petrified
What am I supposed to do to get by?
Did I lose everything I need to survive?
'Cause it's four am and the sweat sets in
Did you get my message, did it send?
Or did you just get on with your life?
I'm taking time to thinking I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around
And run away, run away
What am I supposed to do with these clothes?
It's my twisted way of keep you close
I'm a nervous wreck, I'm a broken man
Did you get my message, did it send?
Or do you get along on your own?
I'm taking time to thinking I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around
And run away, run away
And it breaks me down when I see your face
You look so different but you feel the same
And I do not understand, I cannot comprehend
The chills your body sends, why did it have to end?
I'm taking time to thinking I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling that I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around
And run away, run away
I'm taking time to thinking I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
And I have this feeling that I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around
And run away, run away
Runaway, runaway
Turn around and run away, run away
Runaway, runaway
But I can't tell you if you run away, run away
Turn around and run away
