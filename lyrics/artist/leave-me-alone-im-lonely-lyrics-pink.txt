Pink
pop
Go away, give me a chance to miss you
Say goodbye, it'll make me want to kiss you
I love you so much more when you're not here
Watchin' all the bad shows, drinking all of my beer
I don't believe Adam and Eve
Spent every goddamn day together
If you give me some room
There will be room enough for two
Tonight leave me alone, I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely
I'm tired, leave me alone, I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely tonight
I don't wanna wake up with another
But I don't wanna always wake up with you either
No you can't hop into my shower
All I ask for is one fuckin' hour
You taste so sweet
But I can't eat the same thing every day
Cuttin' off the phone, leave me the fuck alone
Tomorrow I'll be beggin' you to come home
Tonight leave me alone, I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely
I'm tired, leave me alone, I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely tonight
Go away, come back, go away, come back
Why can't I just have it both ways?
Go away, come back, go away, come back
I wish you knew the difference
Go away, come back
Go away, give me a chance to miss you
Say goodbye, it'll make me want to kiss you
Go away, give me a chance to miss you
Say goodbye, it'll make me want to kiss you
Go away, give me a chance to miss you
Say goodbye, it'll make me want to kiss you
Tonight leave me alone, I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely
I'm tired, leave me alone, I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely
Tonight leave me alone, I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely
I'm tired, leave me alone, I'm lonely
Alone, I'm lonely tonight
Tonight
(Go away, give me a chance to miss you)
Leave me alone, I'm lonely
(Say goodbye, it'll make me want to kiss you)
Alone, I'm lonely
I'm tired
(Go away, give me a chance to miss you)
Leave me alone, I'm lonely
(Say goodbye, it'll make me want to kiss you)
Alone, I'm lonely
Tonight
(Go away, give me a chance to miss you)
(Say goodbye, it'll make me want to kiss you)
