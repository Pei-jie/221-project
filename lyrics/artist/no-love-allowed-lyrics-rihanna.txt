9-1-1 it's a critical emergency, yeah
Betta run run run comin' chargin with the 1-4-3, yeaaah
Told me this world was mine
Such a beautiful lie
Now he's done done done and his love is no more for me
Hand in the air as he wave me good bye
He said he care but no tears in his eyes
And asked me if I'm alright
N*gga is you blind?
Like a bullet your love hit me to the core
I was flying til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more
Ye, I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us
I call it murder, no love allowed
Ye, I'm screaming it murder, no love allowed
Yeaaahhh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeahhhh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahhhh
Fee foe fum like the sky's falling down on me
Numb numb numb he's so cold he doesn't feel a thing, nooo
Broken heart was the case
Gwan and put him away
He's the only one one one I ever let get the best of me
Hand in the air as he wave me goodbye-ah
He said he care but no tears in his eye-ah
And ask me if I'm alright
N*gga is you blind
Like a bullet your love hit me to the core
I was flying til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more
Ye, I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us
I call it murder, no love allowed
Yeaaahhh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeahhhh, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahhhh
Usually I'm the one that they cry for,
But this man, he's the one that I die for,
Mamma said there's no cause for a rebel
Do you hear me now?
Ooooooooo, oooooooo
Ooooooooo, no love, no love, no love allowed!!!
Like a bullet your love hit me to the core
I was flying til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish how you keep me wanting more
Aye, I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us
I call it murder, no love allowed
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us
I call it murder, no love allowed.
