This is for the soldiers
That see the sun at midnight
You dig, let me slow down
It's so incredible
I go to the grave before I be a bitch, nigga
Better behave, you're dealin' with some rich niggas
We the lost symbols speak in cryptic codes
Ancient wisdom valuable like gifts of gold
I embark on life, my path is all math
I understand the codes these hackers can't crack
I understand that folks expect me to fold
Community control to violate parole
I won't fail but a lot of men will
I'm iconic in the field like Solomon's seal
Uh, it's just an intro
Allow my flow time to sink into the temple
Free mason, freelancer, free agents, we faster
Big contracts, big contractors, built pyramids, period we masters
No caterpillars, it was just a lot of niggas
A lot of great thinkers and a lot of great inventors
All white mansion, I'm the child of God
All black diamonds, times were hard
New Rolls Royce, guess, you made it, nigga
All white neighborhoods, you they favorite nigga
My top back like J.F.K.
They wanna push my top back like J.F.K.
So, so I J.F.K.
Join forces with the kings and we ate all day
Right now I could rewrite history
I stopped writin' so fuck it, I'll do it mentally
I go to the grave before I be a bitch, nigga
Better behave, you're dealin' with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplyin' and I pray to God we never die
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you're dealin' with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplyin' and I pray to God, we never die
Niggas couldn't do nothin' with me
They put the devil on me
I would have preferred if niggas
Would squeeze the metal on me
Rumors of Lucifer, I don't know who to trust
Whole world want my demise
Turn my music up, here me clearly
If y'all niggas fear me just say y'all fear me
Fuck all these fairy tales
Go to hell, this is God engineerin'
This is a Hail Mary pass, y'all interferin'
He without sin shall cast the first stone
So y'all check in the mirror, double check your appearance
Bitch I said I was amazin', not that I'm a mason
It's amazin' that I made it through the maze that I was in
Lord forgive me, I never would've made it without sin
Holy water, my face in the basin
Diamonds in my rosary shows he forgave him
Bitch, I'm red hot, I'm on my third six but the devil I'm not
My Jesus piece flooded but thou shall not covet
Keep your eyes off my cupboard
I'm a bad motherfucker, it's Hov just say you love it
I go to the grave before I be a bitch, nigga
Better behave, you're dealin' with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplyin' and I pray to God we never die
I go to the grave before I be a bitch, nigga
Better behave, you're dealin' with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplyin' and I pray to God we never die
If I ever die, never let it be said I didn't win
Never, never say
Never say legend didn't go in
I'ma go in
I just wanna die on top of the world
Makin' love to my favorite girl
I'm makin' beautiful music, we makin' a movie
We knew we was born to do it
I go to the grave before I be a bitch, nigga
Better behave, you're dealin' with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplyin' and I pray to God, we never die
I go to the grave before I be a bitch, nigga
Better behave, you're dealin' with some rich niggas
Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide
Multiplyin' and I pray to God, we never die
