I came up in this party, time to twerk
I came up in this party and I'm turnt
I came up in this party, time to twerk
Twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk
[Lil Twist:]
South side up in this, east side on the floor
West side throw it up, north side by the pole
Okay, I'm Nascar and I'm moving faster than you've ever seen before
No turning keys, I'm turnt up like 'push the button, go'
Turn the hash to the club, what you sitting on?
Tell the DJ run it back, have a sing-along
'Til them niggas come through, they can turn up too
Like run the king, get it up get along
23â€²s on my feet what I'm sitting on
Gotta walk a straight line, what you tripping on?
Every day in the news trying to start something new
About to find out who they picking on

I valet the car, throw me the keys
It's time to go, girl you coming with me
Girl I've been looking for ya for a while now
I would come and talk to you but it's loud now
Girl, we can take it slow
Don't need nobody to know
(Don't need nobody)
Let me see you get down on the floor girl girl
We gon' party all night till it's over!

Girl, I can't believe what you do to me
Got a feeling that I'm running outta of time
And I really hope that you come closer
closer, closer, closer, closer
[Lil Twist:]
Let closer up on that, hold up on that
Twizzy 'bout to pose up on that
don't waste the time we both need
don't regret this day when you leave!
Just get sprung of that, don't back of that
Once you turn on you can't turn back
Can't believe what I see Miley Ray J's dropped it on me! Twerk!
