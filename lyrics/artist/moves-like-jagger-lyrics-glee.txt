other
Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right
And aim for my heart
If you feel like
You can take me away, and make it okay
I swear I'll behave.
You wanted control
So we waited
I put on a show
Now were naked
I was born in crossfire hurricane
And I howled at ma
In the driving rain
Goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you
You want the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the jumping jack flash, it's a gas gas gas.
I don't even try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the moooves like jagger.
I was born in crossfire hurricane
And I howled at ma
In the driving rain
Goes like this.
But it's alright now
I'm jumping jack flash, it's a gas gas gas
And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you
You want the moves like jagger
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the jumping jack flash, it's a gas gas gas.
I don't even try to control you (but it's alright)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you(but it's alright)
With the moves like jagger(but it's alright)
I've got the moves like jagger
I've got the moooves like jagger.
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas gas gas
