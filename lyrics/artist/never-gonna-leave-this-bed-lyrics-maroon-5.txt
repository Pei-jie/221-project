rock
You push me
I don't have the strength to
Resist or control you
So take me down, take me down
You hurt me
But do I deserve this?
You make me so nervous
Calm me down, calm me down
Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed
So come here
And never leave this place
Perfection of your face
Slows me down, slows me down
So fall down
I need you to trust me
Go easy, don't rush me
Help me out, why don't you help me out?
Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed
So you say go, it isn't workin'
And I say no, it isn't perfect
So I stay instead
I'm never gonna leave this bed
Take it, take it all, take all that I have
I'd give it all away just to get you back
And fake it, fake it, I'll take what I can get
Knocking so loud, can you hear me yet?
Try to stay awake, but you can't forget
Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed
You say go, it isn't workin'
And I say no, it isn't perfect
So I stay instead
I'm never gonna leave this bed
Take it, take it all, take all that I have
Take it, take it all, take all that I have
Take it, take it all, take all that I have
Take it, take it all, take all that I have
Take it, take it all, take all that I have
Take it, take it all, take all that I have
Take it, take it all, take all that I have
