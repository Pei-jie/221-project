Weak
I had been crying and crying for weeks
How'd I survive when I could barely speak?
Barely eat, on my knees
But that's the moment you came to me
I don't know what your love has done to me
Think I'm invincible
I see through the me I used to be
You changed my whole life
Don't know what you're doing
To me with your love
I'm feeling all superhuman you did that to me
A superhuman heart beats in me
Nothing can stop me here with you
Superhuman
I feel so superhuman
Superhuman
I feel so superhuman
Superhuman
Strong
Since I been flying and riding the wrongs
Feels almost like I had it all along
I can see tomorrow
Where every problem is gone because
I flew everywhere with love inside of me
It's unbelievable to see
How love can set me free
You changed my whole life
Don't know what you're doing
To me with your love
I'm feeling all superhuman you did that to me
A superhuman heart beats in me
Nothing can stop me here with you
Superhuman
I feel so superhuman
Superhuman
I feel so superhuman
It's not a bird, not a plane
It's my heart and its going gone away
My only weakness is you, only reason is you
Every minute with you I feel like I can do anything
Going, going I'm gone away! In love!
You changed my whole life
Don't know what you're doing
To me with your love
I'm feeling all superhuman you did that to me
A superhuman heart beats in me
Nothing can stop me here with you
Superhuman
Superhuman
