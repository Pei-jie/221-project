Baby, can't you see? I'm calling
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm fallin'
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit
Baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm lovin' it
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head
Spinning 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
It's getting late
To give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air
And it's all around
Oh, can you feel me now?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're toxic?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
With a taste of poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?
Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now
With your lovin' now
I think I'm ready
I think I'm ready now
