I conjure up the thought of being gone
But I'd probably even do that wrong
I try to think about which way
Would I be able to? And would I be afraid?
'Cause oh, I'm bleeding out inside
Oh, I don't even mind, yeah
It's all your fault, you called me beautiful
You turned me out and now I can't turn back
I hold my breath 'cause you were perfect
But I'm running out of air and it's not fair
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
I'm trying to figure out what else to say
To make you turn around and come back this way
I feel like we could be really awesome together
So make up your mind 'cause it's now or never
It's all your fault, you called me beautiful
You turned me out and now I can't turn back
I hold my breath because you were perfect
But I'm running out of air and it's not fair
I would never pull the trigger
But I've cried wolf a thousand times
I wish you could feel as bad as I do
I have lost my mind
It's all your fault, you called me beautiful
You turned me out and now I can't turn back
I hold my breath because you were perfect
But I'm running out of air and it's not fair
I hold my breath because you were perfect
But I'm running out of air and it's not fair
