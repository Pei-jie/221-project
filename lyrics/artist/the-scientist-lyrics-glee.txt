Finn:
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Blaine:
Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions
Oh let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming in tails
Heads on a science apart
Santana:
Nobody said it was easy
Finn and Blaine:
It's such a shame for us to part
Santana:
Nobody said it was easy
Finn and Blaine:
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start.
Kurt:
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Brittany:
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
Will and Emma:
And tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Finn and Rachel:
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are
Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start
Nobody said it was easy x6
