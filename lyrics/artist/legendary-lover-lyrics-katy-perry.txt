Under a silver moon, tropical temperature,
I feel my lotus bloom, come closer.
I want your energy, I want your aura,
you are my destiny, my mantra.
I never knew I could see something so clearly
Looking through my third eye
I never knew karma could be so rewarding and
Bring me to your life
Maybe this is the beginning of something so
Magical tonight, ah, ah
Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers
We could be legendary la la la la
Legendary lovers
We should be legendary la la la la
Go down in history, go down together,
Into infinity forever.
You're cleopatra, you're blushing Juliet,
anything for your love, a ride or die.
I never knew I could see something so clearly
Looking through my third eye
I never knew karma could be so rewarding and
Bring me to your life
Maybe this is the beginning of something so
Magical tonight, ah, ah
Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers
We could be legendary la la la la
Legendary lovers
We should be legendary la la la la

Ah ooh
Le-gen-da-ry lovers
Le-gen-da-ry lovers
Le-gen-da-ry lovers
Ah ooh
Oh,
Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers
We could be legendary la la la la
Legendary lovers
We should be legendary la la la la
Oh,
Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood-orange sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum
Legendary lovers
We could be legendary la la la la
Legendary lovers
We should be legendary la la la la
