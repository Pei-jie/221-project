Get your ass up for the doctor( I've become so numb.......)
One more time get your ass up for the doctor
Come on now here we go!( Can I get an encore? Do you want more. more more)
Cliff hanger, its another club banger.
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat.
Get on down!
[Dr. Dre]
Times up, games over you lose I win
'bout to show this knuckleheads how to do this here.
Ooh yeah, new year next phase begin.
Look who's got you goin' crazy again.
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in.
I go out and just come back full circle again.
You're a fad.
That means you're something we already had.
But once you're gone, yeah
Dont come back.
[Eminem]
Too bad, You're off the map now, radar can't even find you.
You stay on the grind, you slip.
We out grind you.
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you.
We walk around, just playing the violin behind you( We walk around just playing the violin behind you)
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'( Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin')
Sit and observe, listen.
You'll learn if you'll pay attention.
Why ten multi platinum albums later, three diamond.
Worldwide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'(Worldwide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin')
[Jay-Z]
Can I get an encore?
Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with a Brooklyn boy.
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
uh-uh-woo.
[Linkin Park]
What the hell are you waiting for?
[Jay Z]
After me there should be no more
So for one last time nigga make some noise
[Eminem]
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time.
When Dr. Dre says crunk,
You'll get it crunk. (Get it crunk)
Crunk, crunk, crunk.
And when 50 cent says jump,
You get on one foot and (Jump!!)
Jump Jump Jump!!
[Dr. Dre]
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it.
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that-
Doc is off the benches.
[Eminem]
We keep the party rockin' off the hinges.
We ain't showin' off,
We just goin' off on popular consensus.
[Dr. Dre]
But critics say, Doc is soft, Doc is talk,
Doc is all washed up, knock it off.
Who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression.
You must be on the cock of Doc,
Cause Doc left you all guessin'.
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record( What??)
We gon' have this motherfucker hoppin' in a second.( Bom, bom)
That's why we always save the best cut last.
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass.
[Eminem]
We done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators.
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers,
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap.
May be raised to be racist,
Who may have never got to see our faces,
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages,
Broke down barriers of languages and races.
Just call on the Cape Crusaders,
and leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic and
we can play the-
Back and forth all day,
Like the hot potato game, that's why we all came to-
Came here to set this party off right,
Lets bounce tonight.
[Linkin Park]
What the hell are you waiting for?
[Jay Z]
After me there should be no more
So for one last time nigga make some noise
Yea buddy-woo-woo-woo
[Linkin Park]
I've become so numb.
[Jay-Z]
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar.
[Linkin Park]
Every step that I take is another mistake to you.
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take.
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there,
Become so tired, so much more aware,
I'm becoming this, all I want to do,
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb.
[Jay-Z]
Can I get an encore?
Do you want more?
[50 Cent]
Bounce now, hands up you know how we do.
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret everybody know.
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
[Dr. Dre]
And plenty honey's involved,
The sunny Sundays and palm trees Cali,
Everyday's just another party from the valleys,
All the way to them
8-mile alley lets rally(8 mile alley lets rally)
[Eminem]
Hands up for the grand finale,
Now raise up out your seat,
Dre's about to speak.
Blaze a pound of weed,
Six days up out the week.
[Dr.Dre]
You could catch me in the studio, bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat, that keep blazin' out your speaker.
[Eminem]
So never say never cause Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records present the return of the
Doc and Shady
No one can do it better
We tear up the club and leave without a strand of evidence uh
[Jay-Z]
Now can I get an encore?
Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy,
So for one last time I need y'all to roar,
uh-uh-uh-uh.
[Linkin Park]
I've become so numb
[Jay Z]
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to-
