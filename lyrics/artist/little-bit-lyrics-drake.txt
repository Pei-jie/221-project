Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hands down, I'm too proud for love
But with eyes shut it's you I'm thinking of
But how we move from A to B?
It can't be up to me 'cause you don't know
Eye to eye, thigh to thigh, I let go
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love for you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit
Little bit in l-l-love for me, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And for you I keep my legs apart
And forget about my tainted heart
And I will never ever be the first
To say it but still I, you know I, I, I
I would do it
Push a button, pull a trigger
Climb a mountain, jump off a cliff
'Cause you know, baby
I love you, love you a little bit
I would do it, I would say it
I would mean it and we could do it
It was you and I and I only
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love for you
But only if you're a little, little bit
Little bit in l-l-love for me
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love for you
But only if you're a little, little bit
Little bit in l-l-love for me, oh
Come here, stay with me
Stroke me by the hair
'Cause I would give anything, anything
To have you as my man
Come here, stay with me
Stroke me by the hair
'Cause I would give anything, anything
To have you as my man
Little bit, little bit
A little bit in love for you
But only if you're a little, little bit
Little bit in l-l-love for me
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love for you
But only if you're a little, little bit
Little bit in l-l-love for me
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little, little bit
Little bit
Little bit, little bit
Little bit, little bit
Little bit
