Drake
hiphop
[ Chorus ] *Drake*
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ('ever mayne, 'ever mayne)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ('ever mayne, 'ever mayne)
[ Verse 1 ] *Drake*
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
And your city faded off to brown, Nino
She insists she got mo' class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo
Dropped a mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour be the outcome
Labels want my name beside an X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hitlist
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, Bitches
[ Chorus ] *Drake*
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ('ever mayne, 'ever mayne)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ('ever mayne, 'ever mayne)
[ Verse 2 ] *Kanye West*
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I could make it rain, all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they gon' build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, what? nothin'
Nuh, superbad chicks giving me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't (fuckin' wasn't)
Uh, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
'member she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasing the stardom'll turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out, and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back
[ Chorus ] *Drake*
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ('ever mayne, 'ever mayne)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ('ever mayne, 'ever mayne)
[ Verse 3 ] *Lil Wayne*
Ok, hello it's the martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hopped up in my car, and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fuckin' rollercoaster then it drops
But what should I scream for? this is my theme park!
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the King talk, check the price and pay attention
Little Wayne, thats what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foot's sleepin on the gas
No break pads, no such thing as last
[ Chorus ] *Drake*
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ('ever mayne, 'ever mayne)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ('ever mayne, 'ever mayne)
[ Verse 4 ] *Eminem*
There they go, back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamian, they go so ballistic whoa
We can make them look like Bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He aint had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashin' into the brains of these hoes
And establishin a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking bout when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villians
Who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it!
Payback muthafucka for the way that you got at me
So how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just incase
You was thinkin of savin face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake
[ Chorus ] *Drake*
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ('ever mayne, 'ever mayne)
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ('ever mayne, 'ever mayne)
