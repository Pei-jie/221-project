[Sean]
When you curse your name I'm a receiver
When your heart can't change I'm a receive
Do I love like a stranger?
The world keeps getting stranger all the time
And the distance is greater
Than any rope I ever tied around your waist
To keep our tumbles in rhythm
[Peter]
I cursed being a man
I cursed being the driver
I let go of the wheel sometime last year
Then I sang to you in shifts
Till the mountains folded over
And your wrongs went through my wrists so you could sin
[Everyone]
I love the world, I want to take it with me
Oh, a heart is a pocket for loose change
We scrape and we save and we wait for a raise
Did you watch as our muscles divided in rhythm?
Come on I want it to be a gental rhythm
[Beat]
[Adam M]
I'm Adam Maples born to be a caucassion but it makes no difference what persuasion you are
As long as you know how to get up on the floor and start workin' a sweat
To a musical measure that makes you move as soon as the needle drops into the groove
So get up and dance to the gift I'm giving, forget about your troubles get into the rhythm
[Evan]
You linger for the rap singer, when Donald D brings the party to the deal my presence is felt world wide
You don't dance to this it's suicide
Put your hands into the air on, the M.C. cop, the girlies are pipen' hot
Natorious Lama is how I'm livin' don't step to me step to the rhythm
[Everyone]
I love the world, I want to take it with me
Oh, a heart is a pocket for loose change
We scrape and we save and we wait for a raise
Did you watch as our muscles divided in rhythm?
Come on I want it to be a gental rhythm
[Beat]
[The Killers]
Listen to the tracks that rolls, watch the mic as it glows
The lethal weapon got you trapped in this dance mode
We need rhythm for the world to have peace and unity, we must first have rhythm
You know, this old worls just,
Keeps on spinning around and around and around
And sometimes it just spins too fast
And you, you not only lose you r balance
But you lose your rhythm and
It's at times like these that you just need to stop
And not only find your way again but find your own rhythm
Because life has a rhythm...
[Everyone]
I love the world, I want to take it with me
Oh, a heart is a pocket for loose change
We scrape and we save and we wait for a raise
Did you watch as our muscles divided in rhythm?
Come on I want it to be a gental rhythm
[Beat]
