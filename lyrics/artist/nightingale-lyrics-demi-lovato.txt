I can't sleep tonight, wide awake and so confused
Everything's in line, but I am bruised
I need a voice to echo, I need a light to take me home
I kinda need a hero, is it you?
I never see the forest for the trees
I could really use your melody
Baby I'm a little blind
I think it's time for you to find me
Can you be my Nightingale?
Sing to me, I know you're there
You could be my sanity
Bring me peace, sing me to sleep
Say you'll be my Nightingale
Somebody speak to me, cause I'm feeling like hell
Need you to answer me, I'm overwhelmed
I need a voice to echo, I need a light to take me home
I need a star to follow, I don't know
I never see the forest for the trees
I could really use your melody
Baby I'm a little blind
I think it's time for you to find me
Can you be my Nightingale?
Sing to me, I know you're there
You could be my sanity
Bring me peace, sing me to sleep
Say you'll be my Nightingale
I don't know what I'd do without you
Your words are like a whisper cutting through
As long as you're with me here tonight, I'm good
Can you be my Nightingale?
Feel so close, I know youre there
Ohhhh Nightingale
Sing to me, I know you're there
Cause baby you're my sanity
You bring me peace, sing me to sleep
Say you'll be my Nightingale, oh
