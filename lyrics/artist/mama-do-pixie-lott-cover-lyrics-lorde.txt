Uh oh, Uh oh
Every night I go,
Every night I go sneaking out the door.
I lie a little more,
Baby I'm a helpless.
There's somethin' 'bout the night,
And the way it hides all the things I like.
Little black butterflies deep inside me.
What would my mamma do?
Uh oh, Uh oh
She know about me and you?
Uh oh, Uh oh
What would my daddy say?
Uh oh, Uh oh
He saw me hurt this way?
Uh oh, Uh oh
Why should I feel ashamed?
Feeling guilty at the mention of your name?
Yet here we are again,
It's nearly perfect.
What would my mamma do?
Uh oh, Uh oh
She know about me and you?
Uh oh, Uh oh
What would my daddy say?
Uh oh, Uh oh
He saw me hurt this way?
Uh oh, Uh oh
