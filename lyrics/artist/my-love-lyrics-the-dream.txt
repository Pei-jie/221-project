[The Dream]
Radio Killa
did a song with the American Dream
They can't put it down like this, no no no no
Im her baby, she my shawty
Oh, we rockin
They got our sh*t all up in the press
They hate on us
Now whos right there every time you cry?
Gonna sleep and wake up on your side?
Endless love I'll always provide
They hatin on us and you should know why
But whos be lovin you lately?
Whos willing to go half on the baby?
Who ooo ooos trying to flag our ship?
They just tryin to get the love you give
But baby,
[Chorus]
Tell me what they know about my love (my love) [x8]
Ohhhhhhhhh, Ohhhhhhhhhhh, Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh, Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[Mariah Carey]
So they dont understand why I'll never leave you
Explain my love? I dont need to
Got everybody way up in our business
Cuz leavin each other stay on their wish list
I see them reachin everytime you call me baby
They on my back like a shirt, get off me baby
They dont love me, let them wonder why
Here to stay and they going bye bye
Whos the one calling you baby?
Whos in love with your ass like crazy?
Who who whos gonna flag our ship?
They just tryna get the love u give baby
Tell me what they know about my love (my love)[x8]
Ohhhhhhhhh, Ohhhhhhhhhhh, Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh, Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
My love is your love
There aint nothing in this world that they can do to make me give you up
Oh baby you will always be my girl
so let them do whatever, say whatever
Cuz I ain't givin her up
Tell me what they know about my love (my love) [x8]
