rock
When the roll is called up yonder
I hope you see me there
It's in the water
It's where you came from
It's in the water
It's where you came from
And the crowd begins to wonder
And they cry to see your face
It's in the water...
It's in the story
It's where you came from
The sons and daughters
In all their glory
It's gonna shape them
And when they clash
And come together
And start rising
Just drink the water
Where you came from...
Where you came from
You're the rose
That was called from yonder
Never sold yourself away
It's in the water...
It's in the story
It's where you came from
The sons and daughters
In all their glory
It's gonna shape them
And when they clash
And come together
And start rising
Just drink the water
Where you came from...
Where you came from
And when they clash
And come together
And start rising
Just drink the water
Where you came from...
Where you came from
