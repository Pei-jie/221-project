I'm giving up on everything
Because you messed me up
Don't know how much you screwed it up
You never listened that's just too bad
Because I'm moving on, I won't forget
You were the one that was wrong
I know I need to step up and be strong
Don't patronize me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Have you forgotten
Everything that I wanted?
Do you forget it now? You never got it
Do you get it now?
Gotta get away
There's no point in thinking about yesterday
It's too late now, it won't ever be the same
We're so different now
Have you forgotten
Everything that I wanted?
Do you forget it now? You never got it
Do you get it now?
I know I wanna run away, I know I wanna run away
Run away
If only I could run away, if only I could run away
Run away
I told you what I wanted, I told you what I wanted
What I wanted
But I was forgotten, I won't be forgotten
Never again
Have you forgotten
Everything that I wanted?
Do you forget it now? You never got it
Do you get it now? Do you get it now?
Have you forgotten
Everything that I wanted?
Do you forget it now? You never got it
Do you get it now?
Have you forgotten
Do you get it now?
Forgotten, yeah, yeah, yeah
Forgotten, yeah, yeah, yeah
Forgotten, yeah, yeah, yeah
Forgotten, yeah, yeah, yeah
