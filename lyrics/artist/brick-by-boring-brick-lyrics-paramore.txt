Paramore
rock
Oh, she lives in a fairy tale
Somewhere too far for us to find
Forgotten the taste and smell
Of a world that she's left behind
It's all about the exposure the lens
I told her the angles were all wrong
Now she's ripping wings off of butterflies
Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds
Well, go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle
Pa ra pa pa ra pa pa ra
So one day, he found her crying
Coiled up on the dirty ground
Her prince finally came to save her
And the rest you can figure out
But it was a trick and the clock struck twelve
Well, make sure to build your home brick by boring brick
Or the wolf's gonna blow it down
Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds
Well, go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
I want bury the castle, bury the castle
Well, you built up a world of magic
Because your real life is tragic
Yeah, you built up a world of magic
If it's not real
You can't hold it in your hands
You can't feel it with your heart
And I won't believe it
But if it's true
You can see it with your eyes
Oh, even in the dark
And that's where I want to be, yeah
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle
Pa ra pa pa ra pa pa ra
Pa ra pa pa pa ra pa pa
Pa ra pa pa ra pa pa ra
Pa ra pa pa pa ra pa pa
Pa ra pa pa ra pa pa ra
Pa ra pa pa pa ra pa pa
Pa ra pa pa ra pa pa ra
Pa ra pa pa pa p-pa pa pa
