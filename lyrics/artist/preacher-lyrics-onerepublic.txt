When I was a kid, I used to buy and sell gravity
I knew how to fly, and I would teach you for a free
Broke every window in my hotel heart
When I was only 5 years old, the 12 years scar
But I'd hear the same voice echo in my mind
See son you got an angel, to chase the devil out the mind, yeah
[Chorus]
When I was a kid, my grandfather was a preacher
He'd talk about God, yeah he was something like a teacher
He said God only helps those
Who learn to help themselves
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you can never spend his wealth
I took a little faith, and put it in a parking lot
I drove to a strange town, full of have and have nots
Yeah, and as I walk through that storybook life
I'll be looking for an angel, to chase the devil out the mind, whoa
[Chorus]
When I was a kid, my grandfather was a preacher
He'd talk about love, yeah he was something like a teacher
He said God only helps those
Who learn to help themselves
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you can never spend his wealth
Wave, put your hands up, and hands down
Wave, put your hands up, and hands down
Wave, put your hands up, and hands down
[Chorus]
When I was a kid, my grandfather was a preacher
He'd talk about life, yeah he was something like a teacher
He said God only helps those
Who learn to help themselves
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you can never spend his wealth
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you can never spend his wealth
