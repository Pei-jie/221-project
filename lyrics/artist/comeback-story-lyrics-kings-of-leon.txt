rock
Picking up the pieces in the world I know
With one in the fire and one in the snow
It's a comeback story of a lifetime
A comeback story of a lifetime
Bent on believing everything is alright
I break with the day and I've been with the night
It's a comeback story of a lifetime
A comeback story of a lifetime
I walk a mile in your shoes
And now I'm a mile away
And I've got your shoes/
The brighter the lights they're burning me out
Everyone says it's a lovely sound
I don't know where they are leaving me
Trying my best, hoping that you'll see
I walk a mile in your shoes
And now I'm a mile away
And I've got your
I walk a mile in your shoes
Now I'm a mile away
And I've got your shoes/
You'll rue the day when you understand
I did my best to be an honest man
Race isn't over to the finish line
It's a comeback story of a lifetime
I walk a mile in your shoes
And now I'm a mile away
And I've got your shoes
Now I'm a mile away
And I've got your shoes
Now I'm a mile away
