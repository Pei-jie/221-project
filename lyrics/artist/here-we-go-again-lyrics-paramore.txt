Paramore
rock
And here we go again with all the things we said
And not a minute spent to think that we'd regret
So we just take it back these words and hold our breath
Forget the things we swore, we meant
I'll write you just to let you know that I'm alright
Can't say, I'm sad to see you go
'Cause I'm not, well, I'm not
And here we go again with all the things we did
And now I'm wondering, just who would I have been
To be the one attached at all time to your hip
Forget the things we swore, we meant
I'll write you just to let you know that I'm alright
Can't say, I'm sad to see you go
'Cause I'm not, well, I'm not
I'll write you, to let you know that I'm alright
Can't say, I'm sad to see you go
'Cause I'm not, well, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
And here we go again with all the things we said
And not a minute spent to think that we'd regret
So we just take it back, so we just take it back
So we just take it back, so we just take it back
So we just take it back, so we just take it back
So we just take it back, so we just take it back
So we just take it back, so we just take it back
So we just take it back, so we just take it back
