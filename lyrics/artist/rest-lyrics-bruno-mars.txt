Everyday I wake up next to an angel
More beautiful than words could say
They said it wouldn't work but what did they know?
Cause years have passed and we're still here today
Never in my dreams did I think
That this would happen to me
As I stand here before my woman
I can't fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must have done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life
Seems like yesterday when she first said hello
Funny how time flies when your in love
It took us a life time to find each other
It was worth the wait cause I finally found the one
Never in my dreams did I think
that this would happen to me
As I stand here before my woman
I can't fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must have done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life
