As days go by and fade to nights
I still question why you left
I wonder how it didnt work out
But now youre gone
And memories all I have for now
But no, its not over
Well get older, well get over
Well live to see the day that I hope for
Come back to me
I still believe that well get it right again
Well come back to life again
We wont say another goodbye again
Youll live forever with me
Someday, someday
Well be together
Someday, someday
Well be together
I heard someday might be today
Mysteries of destinies
They are somehow and are someway
For all we know they come tomorrow
For today my eyes are open
My arms are raised for your embrace
My hands are here to mend what is broken
To feel again to walk on the face
I believe there is more to life
Oh, I love you much more than life itself
I believe I can change your mind
Revive what is dying inside
And someday, someday
Well be together
Someday, someday
Well be together
Someday, someday
Well be together
Well be together
Well be together someday
