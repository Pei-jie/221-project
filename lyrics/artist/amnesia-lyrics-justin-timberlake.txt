Keeps coming closer
I don't, but she thinks I know her
Beautiful smile with those sad eyes
That was my type
Amnesia that's over
I can see your breathing, girl, is colder
I can see you need me but I don't care
My whole memory of me and love
Gone so far from me girl
It's not fair
I could feel it almost start to change (almost starts to change)
But then it hurts too much
That's when it starts to fade
So cold baby, now I'm going crazy
I don't know why you need me alone
If it was true, if it was you
Don't you think?
Don't you think I would know?
Amnesia, every memory fades away till it's gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia, went from everything to nothing
No we anymore, she's a stranger that I used to know
Peaceful for those of us
So happy, so in love
Tell me what happened
Who are they? Where did they go?
And when was enough, enough
When did all the fire turn colder?
When did your heart start to beat slower?
My whole memory of me in love,is gone so far from me, It's not fair.
And I can feel it almost start to change (almost start to change)
But it just hurts to much, I let it go away
So cold baby, now I'm going crazy
I don't know why you need me alone
If it was true, if it was you
Don't you think?
Don't you think I would know?
Amnesia, every memory fades away till it's gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia, went from everything to nothing
No we anymore, she's a stranger that I used to know
I can feel it almost start to change (almost start to change)
But then it hurts too much I let it go away uuuh
So cold baby (so cold), now I'm going crazy
I don't know why you need me alone
If it was true, if it was you
Don't you think?
Don't you think I would know?
Amnesia, every memory fades away till it's gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia, everything and nothing
No we anymore she's a stranger
Amnesia, every memory fades away till it's gone
Where did you go?
Amnesia, everything and nothing
No we anymore she's a stranger that I used to know
And I don't know you anymore
Everything to nothing
Everything to nothing
She's a stranger that I used to know
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia
Go on and tear me apart
And do it again tomorrow
I almost forgot
Who you are
I try to forget about it every time I see ya, See ya
Thought I could do without it
Now I know I need ya, need ya
This is turning into some kind, some kind of amnesia, I need ya
Memories fade away
Love is so insane,
I try to forget about it, every time I see ya, see ya
Thought I could do without it
Now I know I need ya, need ya
This is turning into some kind, some kind of amnesia, I need ya
Memories fade away
Love is so insane
So tear me apart and do it again tomorrow
I almost forgot who we are
I'll let you drive me crazy for another day
Isn't this love insane, insane? Yeah
