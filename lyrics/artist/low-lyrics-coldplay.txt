You see the world in black and white
No color or light
You think you'll never get it right
But you're wrong, you might
The sky could fall, could fall on me
The parting of the sea
But you mean more, mean more to me
Than any color I can see
All you ever wanted was love
But you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give in itself up
All you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or as up as us
You see the world in black and white
Not painted right
You see no meaning to your life
You should try, you should try
And all you ever wanted was love
But you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give in itself up
And all you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or as up
Don't you wanna see it? Come soon
Floating in a big white balloon
Or given on your own silver spoon
Don't you wanna see it come down
There for throwing your arms around
And say, "You're not a moment too soon"
'Cause I feel low
'Cause I feel low, oh
Yeah, I feel low, oh, oh
Oh, 'cause I feel low, oh
'Cause I feel low, oh
But I feel low, oh no, oh
