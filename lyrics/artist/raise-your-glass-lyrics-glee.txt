Glee
other
Right, right, turn off the lights
We gonna lose our minds tonight
What's the dealio?
I love when it's all too much
5 a.m., turn the radio up
Where's the rock and roll?
Party crasher, penny snatcher
Call me up if you are gangster
Don't be fancy, just get dancey
Why so serious?
So raise your glass if you are wrong in all the right ways
All my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty-gritty, dirty, little freaks
Won't you come on and come on
And raise your glass
Just come on and come on
And raise your glass
Slam, slam, oh, hot damn
What part of party don't you understand?
Wish you'd just freak out
Can't stop, coming in hot
I should be locked up right on the spot
It's so on right now
Party crasher, penny snatcher
Call me up if you are gangster
Don't be fancy, just get dancey
Why so serious?
So raise your glass if you are wrong in all the right ways
All my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty-gritty, dirty, little freaks
Won't you come on and come on
And raise your glass
Just come on and come on
And raise your glass
Just come on and come on
And raise your glass
Just come on and come on
And raise your glass
My glass is empty
That sucks
So if you're too school for cool
And you're treated like a fool
You could choose to let it go
We can always, we can always
Party on our own
So raise your
So raise your glass if you are wrong in all the right ways
All my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty-gritty, dirty, little freaks
So raise your glass if you are wrong in all the right ways
All my underdogs
We will never be, never be anything but loud
And nitty-gritty, dirty, little freaks
Won't you come on and come on
And raise your glass
Just come on and come on
And raise your glass
Won't you come on and come on
And raise your glass for me
Just come on and come on
And raise your glass for me
