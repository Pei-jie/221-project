country
I wanna walk that line a little crooked
And live my life a little on the rocks
Laugh at everytime I fell
Not afraid to make a fool of myself
And keep on dancin' when the music stops
'Cause I love being in love
It's the best kind of drug
Drunk on the high
Leanin' on your shoulder
Sweet like wine as it gets older
When I die - I don't wanna go sober
Oh when I die - I don't wanna go sober
You're like drinkin' from a never ending bottle
When I think it's gone there's always a little more left
Lay back with you and close my eyes
Let the big ol' world just spin on by
And sayin' your name with my last breath
I love being in love
It's the best kind of drug
Drunk on the high
Leanin' on your shoulder
Sweet like wine as it gets older
When I die - I don't wanna go sober
Oh when I die - I don't wanna go sober
I love being in love
It's the best kind of drug
Drunk on the high
Leanin' on your shoulder
Sweet like wine as it gets older
When I die - I don't wanna go sober
Oh I love being in love
It's the best kind of drug
Drunk on the high
Leanin' on your shoulder
Sweet like wine as it gets older
When I die - I don't wanna go sober
When I die - I don't wanna go sober
When I die - I don't wanna go sober
