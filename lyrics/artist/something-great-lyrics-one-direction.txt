[Liam]
One day you'll come into my world and say it all
You say we'll be together even when you're lost
[Zayn]
One day you'll say these words
I thought but never said
You say we're better off together in our bed
[Harry]
I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imagining
Come on, jump out at me
Come on, bring everything
Is it too much to ask for something great?
[Niall]
The script was written and I could not change a thing
I want to rip it all to shreds and start again
[Harry]
One day I'll come into your world and get it right
I'll say we're better off together here tonight
{chorus}
I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imagining
Come on, jump out at me
Come on, bring everything
Is it too much to ask for something great?
[Zayn]
I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imagining
{Chorus}
Come on, jump out at me
Come on, bring everything
Is it too much to ask for something great?
I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
Is it too much to ask for something great?
[Louis]
You're all I want
So much it's hurting
You're all I want
So much it's hurting
