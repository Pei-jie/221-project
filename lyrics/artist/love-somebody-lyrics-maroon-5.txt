rock
I know your insides are feeling so hollow
And its a hard pill for you to swallow
(Refrain)
Yeah, but if I fall for you
I'll never recover
If I fall for you
I'll never be the same
(chorus)
I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there, but you take me all the way
You take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single
day
I know we're only half way there, but you can take me all the way
You can take me all the way
(Repeat refrain)
(repeat chorus)
Youre such a hard act for me to follow
Love me today, don't leave me tomorrow
Yeah but if I fall for you
I'll never recover
If I fall for you
I'll never be the same
I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there, but you take me all the way
You take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there, but you take me all the way
You take me all the way
Whoa whoa whoa oh oh oh
Whoa whoa whoa oh oh oh
I don't know where to start
I'm just a little lost
I want to feel like we're never gonna ever stop
I don't know what to do, I'm right in front of you
Asking you to stay, you should stay, stay with me tonight yeahhh
I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half way there, but you take me all the way
You take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there, but you take me all the way
You take me all the way
