Okay, maybe this is the day
That I have to write a song about love
It's about time
L.O. L.O. L.O. L.O.V.E, love
I said I'd never write a song about love
But when it feels this good
A song fits like a glove
When you hold me and you tell me
That you missed me and call me milky
Fuck it, I'ma write a song about love, yeah
You're my key, you unlock me
Keep me close, keep me safe, keep me happy
So sweet, oh love
It's destiny, so nothing stops me
I'll tell the world that you're mine and you got me
So sweet, oh love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, L.O.V.E, love
See love doesn't choose a boy or a girl, nope
When I met you, you hugged my heart and filled my world
So you can stare, I don't care
You're the one, ain't going nowhere
So fuck it, I'ma be honest with you 'cause
You're my key, you unlock me
Keep me close, keep me safe, keep me happy
So sweet, oh, love
It's destiny, so nothing stops me
I'll tell the world that you're mine and you got me
So sweet, oh, love
I'm in love, I'm in love
(L.O.V.E, love)
I'm in love, I'm in love, yeah
(I'm in love)
My best friend that makes me laugh
The puzzle piece that fits exact to my half
I've never felt this way
Sometimes I'm stuck with what to say
You hold my hand when I'm driving
You dry my tears if I'm crying
And we just laugh if we're fighting
I love you, you love me more
I love you more, more
You love me more
I love you more, yeah
I love you more, yeah
(Love, love, love, love)
Okay so, I actually wrote a love song
(Love, love, love, love)
About someone
(Love, love, love, love)
And it's completely honest
It's destiny, so nothing stops me
I'll tell the world that you're mine, and you got me
So sweet, oh, love
I'm in love
(I'm in love)
I'm in love
I'm in love
(I'm in love)
It's about time, yeah, yeah
L.O.V.E. love
L.O.V.E. love
L.O. L.O.V.E. love
L.O. L.O.V.E. love
