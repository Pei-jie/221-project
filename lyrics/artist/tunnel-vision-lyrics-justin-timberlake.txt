I know you like it
I know you like it
I know you like it
I know you like it
I know you like it
I know you like it
[Verse 1]
Don't know why, but girl, I'm feeling close to you
Maybe is this ocean view, I'm so emotional
And all these thoughts been dancing on my head
Too long, too long, too long!
I wrote a song for you, I wanna sing to you
And every time I'm close to you
The words wanna come out, but I forget
It's so strong, it's so strong, it's so strong!
[Bridge]
It might seem like Im catching something?
Thats because its true
I can't deny it, I won't try it
But I think that you know!
I look around and everything I see is beautiful
Cause all I see is you!
And I can't deny it, and I stand by it
And I won't hide it in my heart
[Pre-hook]
A crowded room anywhere
A million people around all I see is you
And then everything just disappears, disappears, disappears, disappears
Yeah, a million people in a crowded room
But my camera lenses only get set to zoom
And it all becomes so clear, comes so clear, becomes so clear!
[Hook]
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got, I got that tunnel vision for you
I got, I got that tunnel vision for you
I only see you!
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got, I got that tunnel vision for you
I got, I got that tunnel vision for you
I only see you!
[Verse 2]
Now that I know the truth, what am I suppose to do?
Im Changing up and breaking all my rules ever since we met
I'm so gone, I'm so gone, I'm so gone
Just like the movie shoot, I'm zooming in on you
Everything is extra in the background, just fades into the set
As we ride off into the sun
[Bridge]

[Breakdown]
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
In on you, in, in on you!
I only see you!
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
In on you, in, in on you!
I only see you!
I know you like it
I know you like it
I know you like it
I know you like it
I know you like it
I know you like it

[Outro:]
I know you like it
I know you like it
I know you like it
I know you like it
I know you like it
I know you like it
