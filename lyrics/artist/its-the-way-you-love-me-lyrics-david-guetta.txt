Late at night I lose my focus
Late at night I'm calling out for you
It can't be right, I got no focus
I hope you noticed
The chemistry is off the radar
Look at me, I don't know what to do
This chemistry is off the radar
Baby, let me see you later
Over and over you run in my mind
Give me one look and I know
Can't you see we're only wasting our time?
Baby, thought you understood
It's the way you look me
It's the way you move me
And the way you touch me
It's the way you love me
What's the point? I can't remember
Where's the key? Well, give it up to me
You got me boy and I surrender
Let's get you back on my agenda
Over and over you run in my mind
Give me one look and I know
Can't you see we're only wasting our time?
Baby, thought you understood
It's the way you love me
It's the way you move me
And the way you touch me
It's the way you love me
Baby, it's simple to see
This is where I'm meant to be
You stole a piece of my heart
You're making me start all over
It's the way you love me
And the way you move me
It's the way you love me
It's the way you move me
And the way you touch me
It's the way you love me
It's the way you love
Every little thing you do
Everything that you do
You can put me in the mood
You put me in the mood
Now I'm looking straight at you
You're looking at me too
Yeah, you know what I want from you
