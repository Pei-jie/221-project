[Sia:]
You Shout It Out,
But I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud not saying much
I'm criticized by all your bullets ricochet
You shoot me down,But i get up
[chorus:]
I'm bulletproof,nothing to lose
Fire away,fire away
Ricochet,you take your aim
Fire away,fire away
You shoot me down but i won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but i wont fall
i am titanium
[sia:]
Cut me down
But it's you who'll have further to fall
Ghost town and haunted love
Raise your voice,sticks and stones may break my bones
I'm talking loud not saying much
[chorus:]
I'm bulletproof,nothing to lose
Fire away,fire away
Ricochet,you take your aim
Fire away,fire away
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but i won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium
I am titanium
[sia:]
Stone- hard,machine gun
Firing at the one who run
Stone-hard and bulletproof glass
[chorus:]
You shoot me down but i wont fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but i wont fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but i wont fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but i wont fall
I am titanium
I am titanium
