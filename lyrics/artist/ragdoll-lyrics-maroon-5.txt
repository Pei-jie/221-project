How you feelin'?
The day has had its way with both of us
And no, I've gone out of my way
But I'm not free from this pain I'm reelin'
I was a fool to think someday you would come around
But no, no, no, I'm not thinkin' that way
'Cause now I see, you are not what you seem
You are a mystery to me
Sometimes I just wanna scream
I think you should just go away 'cause
There's no necessity for you to stay, yeah
Next time you come around my way
Forget it baby, you're not comin' in
How's your day been? Yeah
'Cause mine has taken strange and lovely turns
But no, no, no, I feel better today
'Cause I'm off my knees, you are not what you seem
You are a mystery to me
Sometimes I just wanna scream, yeah
I think you should just go away 'cause
There's no necessity for you to stay, yeah
Next time you come around my way
Forget it baby, you're not comin' in
A heart ready for a lot of sorrow
No, you can't come back tomorrow
Shut my windows, lock my doors
'Cause my heart won't be your ragdoll anymore, yeah
I think you should just go away 'cause
There's no necessity for you to stay, yeah
Next time you come around my way
Forget it baby, you're not comin' in
A heart ready for a lot of sorrow
No you can't come back tomorrow
Shut my windows, lock my doors
'Cause my heart won't be your ragdoll anymore
'Cause my heart won't be your ragdoll anymore
