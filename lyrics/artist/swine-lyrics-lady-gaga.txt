[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting!
You're just a pig inside...swine.
[Verse 1]
Heard ya, don't speak don't wanna hear another (not another word from you)
You're just a little mole, trying to act real special (but deep down you're just a shrew)
Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind
Cause it's when I'm not thinking with you that I act like a swine!
[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting!
You're just a pig inside...
Do ya, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting!
You're just a pig inside...swine.
[Post-Chorus]
Swineeeeeeeeee!
Swineeeeeeeeee!
Swineeeeeeeeee!
Swineeeeeeeeee!
SWINE!
[Beat break]
SWINE!
[Verse 2]
Payback, how much will I ask you, squealer? (let your body jiggle)
That skinny, love to watch your ass go wiggle (it's the thrill of ecstasy)
Maybe I should have a little more just to stay out of my mind?
Cause it's when I'm not thinking' with you that I act like a swine!
Act like a swine! Act like a swine!
[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting!
You're just a pig inside...
Do ya, I know, I know, I know you want me
You're just a pig inside a human body
Squealer, squealer, squeal out, you're so disgusting!
You're just a pig inside...swine.
[Post Chorus]
Swineeeeeeeeee!
Swineeeeeeeeee!
Swineeeeeeeeee!
Swineeeeeeeeee!
AHHHHH! ... SWINE!
[Beat Break]
[Outro]
Paint you face and
Paint his face and
(Catch the beat)
Paint your face and
Paint her face and
(Catch the beat)
Paint your face and
We are strangers
(Catch the beat)
For the weekend
(Catch the beat)
Ca-Ca-Catch the beat
Ca-Ca-Ca-Catch the beat
Ca-Ca-Catch the beat
SWINE!
