Oh, oh
(Back up)
Haters in the club, back up
Gold diggers, back up
Broke niggaz, back up
I suggest, I suggest that you, back up
I'm in the club and I cut into the scene
Couple of pair fray fool smoking the green
She's got her hand on my nuts what does that mean?
Pointed at her friend and she said there a tag team
Now who said dreams don't come true
It's like I'm dreaming when I come through
I always find something to run through
Speak into the mic mami, mic check one two
Drunk in the club off the chain
But who gives a fuck that's why I came
So pour it up and get down
You have no choice but to listen to Pit now
Put your ass in reverse baby, back up
It don't involve money then, back up
Doggy for me and, back up
Every time I fall I get right, back up
Haters in the club, back up
Gold diggers, back up
Broke niggaz, back up
I suggest, I suggest that you, back up
Everybody knows Pits got tight raps
When I'm in the club DJ's bring it back
When those questions asked but the number one question is
Does he got cash?
Lil Jon's at the bar while me and the East Side Boys smoke out
Roll another one no doubt
Get a couple hoes roll out
Beef you don't want none gun go blao
Dum diddy dum dum, my time's now
The city I'm from is coming with better riles
That ol' make your crew run, run, your crew run, run
It's nice to cum, huh
Put your ass in reverse baby, back up
It don't involve money then, back up
Doggy for me and, back up
Every time I fall I get right, back up
Haters in the club, back up
Gold diggers, back up
Broke niggaz, back up
I suggest, I suggest that you, back up
I convinced mami to creep on the DL
Even though my head is spinning like some Sprewell'z
Skip the details it's the bottom line
That's testing my patience like doctors
I'm not impressed by the cool shit
All those jeans all that ice all them cars all that's bullshit
If that's what you're looking for keep looking hoe
'Cuz you got the wrong one bitch, I'll let ya know
Mami's like damn that groupie shout out
Bitch I came to the club to wild out
If you came to act up
Then you came to get from me bitch and um back up
Put your ass in reverse baby, back up
It don't involve money then, back up
Doggy for me and, back up
Every time I fall I get right, back up
Put your ass in reverse baby, back up
It don't involve money then, back up
Doggy for me and, back up
Every time I fall I get right, back up
Haters in the club, back up
Gold diggers, back up
Broke niggaz, back up
I suggest, I suggest that you, back up
Haters in the club, back up
Gold diggers, back up
Broke niggaz, back up
