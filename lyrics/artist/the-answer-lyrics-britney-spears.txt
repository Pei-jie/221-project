Yeah, I've been waitin' for you
So patiently and now you're here
You're my answer, thank you
I think you're my answer
Here I go
You're the answer
All this time I've tried to find you
I've been yearnin'
You're the answer
To the question that's been burnin'
When they ask me, who I love?
You're the answer, you're my answer
Patiently I've waited
For this day to finally come
Know someday, somehow
I would find that special one
Someone perfect, someone true
Someone that I knew, was you
I know it was you
Who can hold me tight?
Keep me warm, through the night
Who can wipe my tears?
When it's wrong, make it right
Who can give me love, till I'm satisfied?
Who's the one I need in my life?
You're the answer
All this time I've tried to find you
I've been yearnin'
You're the answer
To the question that's been burnin'
When they ask me, who I love?
You're the answer, you're my answer
I can hardly speak because
I'm underneath your spell
Saving every moment
That I have you to myself
Put my love and took the test
'Cuz baby this is destiny
Yeah, this is destiny
Who can hold me tight?
Keep me warm, through the night
Who can wipe my tears?
When it's wrong, make it right
You can give me love, till I'm satisfied
You're the one I need in my life?
You're the answer
All this time I've tried to find you
I've been yearnin'
You're the answer
To the question that's been burnin'
When they ask me, who I love?
You're the answer, you're my answer
You're the answer
All this time I've tried to find you
I've been yearnin'
You're the answer
To the question that's been burnin'
When they ask me, who I love?
You're the answer, you're my answer
Who can hold me tight?
Keep me warm, through the night
Who can wipe my tears?
When it's wrong, make it right
Who can give me love, till I'm satisfied?
Who's the one I need in my life?
You're the answer
All this time I've tried to find you
I've been yearnin'
You're the answer
To the question that's been burnin'
When they ask me, who I love?
You're the answer, you're my answer
You're the answer
You're my answer
You're my answer
You're my answer
