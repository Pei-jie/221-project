93 million miles from the Sun
People get ready, get ready,
'Cause here it comes it's a light
A beautiful light
Over the horizon in to your eyes
Oh, my, my
How beautiful
Oh my beautiful mother
She told me
"Son in life you're gonna go far
And if you do it right
You'll love where you are
Just know that wherever you go
You can always come home"
Ohhohhohh
Ohhohhohh
240 thousand miles from the Moon
You've come a long way to belong here,
To share this view of the night
A glorious night
Over the horizon is another bright sky.
Oh, my, my
How beautiful
Oh my irrefutable father
He told me
"Son sometimes it may seem dark
But the absence of the light is a necessary part
Just know, that youre never alone
You can always come back home"
Ohhohhohh
Ohhohhohh
You can always come backback
Every road is a slippery slope
There is always a hand that you can hold on to.
Looking deeper through the telescope
You can see that your homes inside of you.
Just know, that wherever you go
Oh no you're never alone
You will always get back home
Ohhohhohh
Ohhohhohh
Ohhohh
93 million miles from the Sun
People get ready, get ready,
'Cause here it comes it's a light
A beautiful light
Over the horizon in to our eyes
Ohhohhohh
You can always get backback
Every road is a slippery slope
There is always a hand you can hold on to.
Looking deeper through the telescope
You can see that the homes inside of you.
Just know, that wherever you go
Oh no you're never alone
You can always get back home
Ohhohhohh
Ohhohhohh
Ohhohh
You can always get back home
93 million miles from the Sun
People get ready get ready,
'cause here it comes it's a light
A beautiful light
Over the horizon in to your eyes
