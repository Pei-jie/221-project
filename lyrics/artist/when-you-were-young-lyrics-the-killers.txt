rock
You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch him now, here he comes
He doesnt look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentleman
Like you imagined when you were young
Can we climb this mountain? I dont know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
That's takin' easy, easy now, watch it go
Were burning down the highway skyline
On the back of a hurricane that started turning
When you were young
When you were young
And sometimes you close your eyes
And see the place where you used to live
When you were young
They say the Devils water it aint so sweet
You dont have to drink right now
But you can dip your feet
Every once in a little while
You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch him now, here he comes
He doesnt look a thing like Jesus
But he talks like a gentleman
Like you imagined when you were young
(Talks like a gentleman)
(Like you imagined when)
When you were young
I said he doesnt look a thing like Jesus
He doesnt look a thing like Jesus
But more than youll ever know
