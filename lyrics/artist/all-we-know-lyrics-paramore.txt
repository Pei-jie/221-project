Paramore
rock
We tried so hard to understand, but we can't
We held the world out in our hands and you ran away
It takes some time to let you go and it shows
'Cause all we know is falling, it falls
Remember how 'cause I know
That we won't forget at all
Now we can follow you back home but we won't
Is this what you had waited for? Just to be alone?
It takes some time to let you go and it shows
'Cause all we know is falling, it falls
Remember how 'cause I know
That we won't forget at all
You never, you never said
This wasn't what you wanted
Was it, was it?
This isn't what you wanted
This isn't what you wanted
'Cause all we know is falling, it falls
Remember how 'cause I know
That we won't forget at all
