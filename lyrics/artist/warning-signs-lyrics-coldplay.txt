A warnin' sign
I missed the good part, then I realized
I started lookin', and the bubble burst
I started lookin' for excuses
Come on in
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started lookin' for a warnin' sign
When the truth is, I miss you
Yeah, the truth is, that I miss you so
A warnin' sign
It came back to haunt me, and I realized
That you were an island, and I passed you by
And you were an island, to discover
Come on in
I've gotta tell you, what a state I'm in
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones
That I started lookin' for a warnin' sign, yeah
When the truth is, I miss you
Yeah, the truth is, that I miss you so
And I'm tired, I should not have let you go
So I crawl back into your open arms
Yes, I crawl back into your open arms
And I crawl back into your open arms
Yes, I crawl back into your open arms
