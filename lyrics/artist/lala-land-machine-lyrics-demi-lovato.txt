I am confident, but
I still have my moments.
Baby, that's just me.
I'm not a supermodel
I still eat McDonald's
Baby, that's just me.
Well some may say I need to be afraid
Of losing everything.
Because of where I
had my start, and where I made my name
Well everything's the same
In the La-la land machine. Machine. Machine
Who said I can't wear my
Converse with my dress?
well Baby, That's just me!
Who said I can't be single
and have to go out and mingle
BABYYY, That's not me
Noo, noo.
Well some may say I need to be afraid
Of losing everything.
Because of where I
had my start, and where I made my name
Well everything's the same
In the La-la land.
Tell me do you feel the way I feel
Cause nothing else is real
In the la-la land appeal
(Guitar)
Some may say I need to be afraid
Of losing everything.
Because of where I
had my start, and where I made my name
Well everything's the same
In the La-la land machine
Well, I'm not gonna change
In the La-la land machine
Well I will stay the same
In the La-la land...
Machine hey, yeah.. machine..machine
I won't change anything in my life
(I won't change
anything in my life)
I'm staying myself tonight
(I'm staying myself tonight)
