This goes out to you, this is dedicated to you.....
Dedicated to you, dedicated to you, dedicated to you
It was such such a mellow, mellow, mellow day
When you walk by, the sun shine
Mellow, mellow, mellow day
I, I cant deny the way you caught my eye
I mean something strawberry filled up the sky
And everything on you intoxicates
It's a mystery, I dont know why
I let you get in my do not disturb zone sign
But I guess your mouth emotion got me so high
And I could tell this is pure just by the taste
And you kiss me
So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away
Dont worry about your loving it wont go to waste
Dont ever change your flavor cause I love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way
Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before,
Baby please dont change nothing
Because your flavor's so original
And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey, smacking that Strawberry Bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey, popping that Strawberry Bubblegum
This goes out to you, this goes out to you,
So tell why, we're making love like professionals on the first time
Acting all professional but the worst time
You shouldnt wanna work your inner way
And baby I, I, girl im all addicted and I won't fight
You and me that's the recipe for a good time
And it aint really nothing but clothes in the way
Tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away
Dont worry about your loving it won't go to waste
Dont ever change your flavor cause I love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way
Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before,
And baby please don't change nothing
Because your flavor's so original
And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey, smacking that Strawberry Bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey, popping that Strawberry Bubblegum
My lips are Strawberry Strawberry Bubblegum
My lips are Strawberry Strawberry Bubblegum
She's my little Strawberry Strawberry Bubblegum
My little Strawberry Strawberry Bubblegum,
Hey, hey, hey
my little
hey, hey, hey
Come in, sit down
Let me elevate your appetite
Any flavor you want
Now my selection is the tasty kind
But you, you're delicious on your own
After I break you down my fingers
You're so sweet
That's what you told me when I taste on your lips
Towel under the door
Girl before they pick up your scent
If you'd be strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
If you'd be strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'd love you til I make you pop
Strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
Little girl won't you be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'd love you 'til I make you pop
Hey, hey, hey
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
If you'd be strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
Little girl won't you be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'd love you til I'll make you pop

Little girl if you'd be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'd love you 'til I make you pop
