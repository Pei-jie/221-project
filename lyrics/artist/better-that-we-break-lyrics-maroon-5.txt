I never knew perfection till
I heard you speak and now it kills me
Just to hear you say the simple things
Now waking up is hard to do
Sleeping's impossible too
And every thing's reminding me of you
What can I do?
It's not right, not okay
Say the words that you're saying
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
It's better that we break
A fool to let you slip away
I'll chase you just to hear you say
You're scared enough
You think that I'm insane
The city looks so nice from here
Pity, I can't see it clearly
While you're standing there
It disappears, it disappears
It's not right, not okay
Say the words that you're saying
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
It's better that we break
Saw you sitting on the lawn
You're fragile and you're cold
But that's all right
Life these days is getting rough
Knocked you down and beat you up
But it's just a roller coaster anyway, yeah
It's not right, not okay
Say the words that you're saying
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm not okay
Say the words that you're saying
Maybe we're better off this way
I'm not fine, I'm not okay
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way
It's better that we break, baby
