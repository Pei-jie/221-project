hiphop
[Hook: Future]
I'm on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'mma ball 'til the day I fall
Ball, ball, ball, ball
[Bridge:]
Long as my bitches (yeah, yeah...)
I could give a fuck about no hater, long as my bitches love me
(Yeah, yeah...)
I could give a fuck about no nigga, long as my bitches love me
[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
Pussy-ass niggas stop hatin'
Lil' Tunechi got that fire
And these hoes love me like Satan...
Fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick
She on a strict diet
That's my baby
With no makeup she a ten
And she the best with head
Even better than Corinne
She don't want money
She want the time we could spend
She said "cause I really need somebody,
So tell me you're that somebody"
And girl, I fuck who I want
And fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit
At that Filet Mignon
She say "I never wanna you make you mad,
I just wanna make you proud"
I say "baby, just make me cum,
Then don't make a sound"

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
Real niggas, ffck these haters
These hoes got pussies like craters
Can't treat these hoes like ladies, man...
Pussy, money, weed, codeine
She say my dick feel like morphine
I hope my name tastes like sardines to these niggas
She wake up, eat his dick
Call that breakfast in bed, 69.96
I feel her heartbeat
I touched her chest with this bitch
Now turn around, face down, I'm arresting this bitch
Yeah, all my bitches love me
And I love all my bitches
But it's like soon as I cum
I come to my senses
And I would say these hoes' names
But then I would be snitchin'
And these haters try to knock me
But they can't knock me off the hinges

[Bridge 2: Lil' Wayne]
I lost a few good bitches
Met some more bad bitches
And I be schoolin' them niggas
Pose for your class picture
And kiss my ass if you hatin'
I'm getting' ass while I'm skatin'
I lost a few good bitches
Met some more bad bitches
And I be schoolin' them niggas
Pose for your class picture
And kiss my ass if you hatin'
I'm getting' ass while I'm skatin'
