[Zayn]
Your hand fits in mine
Like its made just for me
But bear this in mind
It was meant to be
And Im joining up the dots
With the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
[Liam]
I know youve never loved
The crinkles by your eyes
When you smile,
Youve never loved
Your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back
At the bottom of your spine
But Ill love them endlessly
CHORUS: [Zayn and Liam]
I wont let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
But if I do
Its you
Oh its you
They add up to
Im in love with you
And all these little things
[Louis]
You can't go to bed
Without a cup of tea
And maybe thats the reason
That you talk in your sleep
And all those conversation
Are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
[Harry]
I know youve never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But youre perfect to me
CHORUS: [Harry and Niall]
I wont let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
but if its true
Its you
Oh its you
They add up to
Im in love with you
And all these little things
[Niall]
Youll never love yourself
Half as much as I love you
Youll never treat yourself right darlin
But I want you to
If I let you know
Im here for you
Maybe youll love yourself like I love you
Oh..
[Harry]
Ive just let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
Because its you
Oh its you
Its you
They add up to
And Im in love with you
And all these little things
[All]
I wont let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
But if its true
Its you
Its you
They add up to
Im in love with you
And all your little things
