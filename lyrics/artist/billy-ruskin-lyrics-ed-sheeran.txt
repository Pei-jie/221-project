Mr Ruskin, come and paint my picture
Were losing sleep 'cos we steal the week
Now whos your best friend?
Can you introduce me?
See I cant seem to even let you breathe
When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my minds eye
Please let me forget that Im standing on my own
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see
That I am more than what is hiding in me
Come and show me, if you can
See I know youre me
But I cant seem to understand
If you know me, place my hand on mine
And we will resurrect the time
That we lost, when you left my mind
Its psycho-paranoia disappearing in time
Come and show me, what makes you tick
I need you to get out of my mind quick
When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my minds eye
Please let me forget that Im standing on my own
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see
That I am more than what is hiding in me
