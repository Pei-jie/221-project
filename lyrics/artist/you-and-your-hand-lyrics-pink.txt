Pink
pop
Check it out, going out
On the late night
Looking tight, feeling nice
It's a cat fight
I can tell, I just know
That it's going down, tonight
At the door we don't wait cause we know them
At the bar six shots just beginning
That's when dick head put his hands on me
But you see
I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really want to mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
'Cause you know it's over
Before it began
Keep your drink just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight
Midnight, I'm drunk
I don't give a fuck
Wanna dance by myself
Guess you're outta luck
Don't touch, back up
I'm not the one, buh-bye
Listen up it's just not happening
You can say what you want to your boyfriends
Just let me have my fun tonight
Aiight
I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really want to mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
'Cause you know it's over
Before it began
Keep your drink just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight
Break break
Break it down
In the corner with your boys, you bet up five bucks
To get at the girl that just walked in but she thinks you suck
We didn't get all dressed up just for you to see
So quit spilling your drinks on me, yeah
You know who you are
High five and talkin' shit
But you're going home alone arentcha?
'Cause I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really want to mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
'Cause you know it's over
Before it began
Keep your drink just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight
I'm not here for your entertainment
You don't really want to mess with me tonight
Just stop and take a second
I was fine before you walked into my life
'Cause you know it's over
Before it began
Keep your drink just give me the money
It's just you and your hand tonight
