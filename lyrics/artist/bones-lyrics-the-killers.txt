The%20Killers
rock
We took a back road, were gonna look at the stars
We took a back road in my car
Down to the ocean, its only water and sand
And in the ocean well hold hands
But I dont really like you, apologetically dressed
In the best put on the heartbeat line
Without an answer the thunder speaks from the sky
And on the cold, wet dirt I cry
And on the cold, wet dirt I cry
Dont you wanna come with me?
Dont you wanna feel my bones on your bones?
Its only natural
A cinematic vision ensued
Like the holiest dream
Theres someone calling, an angel whispers my name
But the message relayed is the same
We'll wait till tomorrow, you'll be gone
And it's gone to the dogs in my mind
I always hear them
When the dead of night comes calling
Save me from this plight
But they can never wrong this right
Dont you wanna come with me?
Dont you wanna feel my bones on your bones?
Its only natural
Dont you wanna swim with me?
Dont you wanna feel my skin on your skin?
Its only natural
(I never had a lover)
I never had a lover
(I never had soul)
I never had soul
(And I never had a good time)
I never had a good time
I never got cold
Dont you wanna come with me?
Dont you wanna feel my bones on your bones?
Its only natural
Dont you wanna swim with me?
Dont you wanna feel my skin on your skin?
Its only natural
Dont you wanna come with me?
Dont you wanna feel my bones on your bones?
Its only natural
Dont you wanna swim with me?
Dont you wanna feel my skin on your skin?
Its only natural
