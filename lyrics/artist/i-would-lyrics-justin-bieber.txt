If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way, so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would, I would
Build a doorway to the sky and hand you the keys,
Let you know that you're always welcome so that you never leave
Buy you all those fancy things that you only see on tv, yeah
Run away to a hide away, we be living the American dream
And i, know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that it won't hurt us to try
If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way, so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would, I would
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh baby I would
I would build the love of a river wide, so that it never runs dry
Anytime you ask me why i'm smiling, say that i'm satisfied
You got your flaws and so do i, past lovers that made you cry
And though I wanna make it right
I just cant read your mind
And i, know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that it won't hurt us to try
If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way, so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would, I would
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh baby I would
Yeah it's not about what I want
It's all about what you need
I know that he hurt you, but that wasnt me
And I know, and I know sometimes it's hard to see
That all we need to be
If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way, so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would, I would
Wo-oh, wo-oh, wo-oh...... Baby I would
