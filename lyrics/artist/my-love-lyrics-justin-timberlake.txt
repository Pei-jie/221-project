Ain't another woman that could take your spot my
If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me
(What would you do?)
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular?
(Tell me would you?)
Well baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl
(Like you)
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you
(Say I do)
Because I could see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I could see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass layin' side by side
You could be my baby
When I look at my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin crazy
See all I want you to do is be
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
My love, love, my love, my love
Now if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile at every word I wrote
(What would you do?)
Would that make you want to change your scene
And want to be the one on my team?
(Tell me would you?)
See, what's the point in waiting anymore?
Cause girl, I never been more sure
(That baby, it's you)
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for
(Just say it, I do)
Because
I could see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I could see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass layin' side by side
You could be my baby
When I look at my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See all I want you to do is be
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
My love, so don't give away
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
My love, love, my love, my love
Shorty cool as a fan
On the new once again
But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Hey listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
Cause the girls real wild, throw they hands up high
When they wanna come kick it wit a stand up guy
You don't really wanna let a chance go by
Because you ain't been seen wit a man so fly
Baby France so fly, I cant go fly
Private, cause I handle my BI
They call me candle guy
Simply cause I am on fire
I hate to have to cancel
My vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try
You don't come, I ain't gonna die
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go, why?
Me and your boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I aint so high
Well baby, you decide just that I ain't your guy
I ain't gon lie, I feel your space
Then forget your face, I swear I will
Same mark, same bullet anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me a pair, I will
I could see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I could see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass layin' side by side
You could be my baby
When I look at my lady
Girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin crazy
See all I want you to do is be
My love, love
My love, love
My love, love
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
My love, love
My love, love
My love, love
Ain't another woman that can take your spot
My love, love, my love, my love
