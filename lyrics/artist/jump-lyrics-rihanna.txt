Tell me that you love me
When you know you don't love me
But I guess I guess I guess it's all good
You can play the game
I'ma still do my thing
Ain't no better way for it to be put
When you fuck them other girls
I bet they be wondering why you always call my name
You think I'm gonna wait around
I ain't got all day, you don't need another lover
Don't you let it go, I already got it covered
Let the others know
If you want it let's do it, ride it my pony
My saddle is waiting, come and jump on it
If you want it let's do it, ride it my pony
My saddle is waiting, come and jump on it
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Think I give a damn
Boy don't you know who I am
I ain't running round chasing no dude
If somebody else like me don't come around
Boy you got it misunderstood
Put it in your face but you acting all scared
Like you can't recognize a good thing
Now that you got a chance
Tell me what it's gon' be
You don't need another lover
Don't you let it go, I already got it covered
Let the others know
If you want it let's do it, ride it my pony
My saddle is waiting, come and jump on it
If you want it let's do it, ride it my pony
My saddle is waiting, come and jump on it
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
You say it's my fault, okay, I get it
You ain't pick up your calls, I'm like forget it
See you put up your wall, you know you did it
The rise and the fall, just admit it
You say it's my fault, okay, I get it
You ain't answer your calls, I'm like forget it
It's the the rise and the fall, it's the the rise and the fall
And you could have had it all
If you want it let's do it, ride it my pony
My saddle is waiting, come and jump on it
If you want it let's do it, ride it my pony
My saddle is waiting, come and jump on it
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump jump, jump on it, jump jump, jump on it
Jump jump, jump on it, jump on it, jump jump on it
Jump jump, jump on it, jump jump, jump on it
Jump jump, jump on it, jump on it, jump jump on it
