She's got tickets to her own show.
But nobody wants to go.
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row.
I'm singing along, like there's no tomorrow.
Its funny how you say that you made it on your own.
When you havent worked for anyone your daddy didn't know
You say ya got a job but I don't know what you do
Such a fucking snob that you'll never know the truth
Youre perfect on the outside but nothing at the core.
Its easy to forget when you show up at my door
Stop messing with my mind, cause youll never have my heart.
But your perfect little body make, make, makes me fall apart
Your perfect little body make, make, makes me fall apart
She's got tickets to her own show.
But nobody wants to go.
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
Singing along, like there's no tomorrow
I know you want to stay, but I think that you should go
Cuz you got nothing to say, you just sit there on your phone.
I tried not to give in, but temptation has me lost
So I will do my best to get, get, get, get, get you off
Youre perfect on the outside but nothing at the core.
Its easy to forget when you show up at my door
Stop messing with my mind, cause youll never have my heart.
But your perfect little body make, make, makes me fall apart
Your perfect little body make, make, makes me fall apart (yeah)
