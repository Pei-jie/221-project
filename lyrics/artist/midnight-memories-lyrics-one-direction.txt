[Verse 1]
Straight out of the plane to a new hotel
Just touched down, you could never tell
Big house party with a crowded kitchen
People talk sh*t but we don't listen
Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Allison Lane
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh wow
[Chorus]
Midnight memories, oh oh oh
Baby you and me
Stumbling in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight memories, oh oh oh
Baby where we go?
Never say no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it
[Verse 2]
5 foot something with the skinny jeans
Don't look back, baby follow me
I don't know where I'm going but I'm finding my way
Same old sh*t but a different day
Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Allison Lane
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh wow
[Chorus]
Midnight memories, oh oh oh
Baby you and me
Stumbling in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight memories, oh oh oh
Baby where we go?
Never say no
Just do it, do it, do it
[Bridge]
You and me and all our friends
I don't care how much we spend
Baby this is what the night is, oh, oh, oh
I know nothing's making sense
For tonight lets just pretend
I don't wanna stop till get me oh
[Chorus]
Midnight memories, oh oh oh
Baby you and me
Stumbling in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight memories, oh oh ohBaby where we go?
Never say no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it
