Baby, you looking fire hot
I have you open all night like you I.H.O.P.
I take you home, baby, let you keep me company
You gimme some of you, I give you some of me
You look good, baby, must taste heavenly
I'm pretty sure that you got your own recipe
So pick it up, pick it up, yeah, I like you
I just can't get enough I gotta drive through
'Cause it's me, you, you, me, me, you
All night
Have it your way, foreplay
Before I feed your appetite
Let me get my ticket, baby, let me get in line
I can tell the way you like, baby, super size
Hold on, you got yours, let me get mine
I ain't leaving 'til they turn over the closed sign, check it
Take my order 'cause your body like a carry out
Let me walk it to your body 'til you hear me out
Turn me on, my baby, don't you cut me out
Turn me on, my baby, don't you cut me out
Take my order 'cause your body like a carry out
Let me walk it to your body 'til it's lights out
Turn me on, my baby, don't you cut me out
Turn me on, my baby, don't you cut me out
Number one, I'll take two number-threes
That's a whole out of you and a side of me
Now is it full of myself to want you full me?
And if its room for dessert then I want a piece
Baby, get my order right, no errors
I'mma touch you in all the right areas
I can feed you, you can feed me
Girl, deliver that to me, come see me
'Cause it's me, you, you, me, me, you
All night
Have it your way, foreplay
Before I feed your appetite
Do you like it well done? 'Cause I do it well
'Cause I'm well seasoned if you couldn't tell
Now let me walk it to your body 'til you hear me out
And turn me on, my baby, don't you cut me out, say
Take my order 'cause your body like a carry out
Let me walk it to your body 'til you hear me out
Turn me on, my baby, don't you cut me out
Turn me on, my baby, don't you cut me out
Take my order 'cause your body like a carry out
Let me walk it to your body 'til it's lights out
Turn me on, my baby, don't you cut me out
Turn me on, my baby, don't you cut me out
What's your name?
