Pitbull
pop
Yeah, hah
Yo, ugh
Yeah
He went from a street kid doin' regular street things
Straight to a street king
Takin' over the city, block by block
Breakin' down bricks, servin' them rock by rock
He's everythin' a young gun wanna grow up to be
But if only these young guns could see
That murder, money and lust is slowly murderin' us
'Cuz the drug game ain't what it used to be
So look deeper when they paint you a picture
And try to sell you a dream
'Cuz a lot of these drug lords turn
To the feds or turn into fiends
The crack game ain't everythin' it's cracked up to be
Now that same cat that was a, neighborhood celebrity
Is coppin' rocks off the news kids on the block
At the same time tryna school them
But these hoodlums got heads
As hard as the rocks that he's doin'
Hustlin's like a drug, it's got withdrawal symptoms
And if you know this, you won't skip fame
But you will gain wisdom
And wisdom gains power
Don't let your life go sour over power
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addictin'
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate
(It's the hustler's withdrawal)
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addictin'

Not only did my father used to deal dope
He used to do the dope he used to deal, I'm jus' keepin' it real
Now my father doesn't have shit, I don't have shit, we don't have shit
'Cuz he didn't stack shit
With all the money he made
He didn't think for one second to put money away
That's 'cuz his mind was clouded with white thoughts
He's lucky that he didn't end up outlined in white chalk
The only thing I can say I gained from my father is
Knowledge of the street game
And I hope that y'all follow this
I can't say I haven't sold weed or cocaine
But I can say this
Money that comes quick, leaves quick
And y'all better believe this
'Cuz this I've lived and witnessed
Catch a couple of charges
Now, you're on the Lord's shit list
Now, you're forced to do business
Until this business does you of course
'Cuz you can die from doin' dope or dealin' dope, either or
You choose the road that you need to follow
And you choose the people
That you look up to as role models
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addictin'
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate
(It's the hustler's withdrawal)

I know about hustler's but I won't mention no names
'Cuz they still got cases pendin'
And some are even, appealin', life in the cage
At least they made it past the first phase, they passed a certain age
Hustlin's like AIDS at first you're infected with HIV and then it's full blown
Only difference is instead of havin' no immune system
You become immune to the system of havin' dough, by dealin' blow
It's a fast life and even if you survive, your mind will die slow
Dirty money attracts, dirty things
And if you plan to deal dope
I hope you're ready for the murder game
'Cuz that's what it brings
I'm not a preacher, I'm not tryin' to preach, no
I'm not a teacher, I'm not tryna teach but yet
Like a faucet, I'm tryin' to leak
Any foe, tell these young'ns and their kinfolk
And let em' know there's more to life than a G of coke
If you used to push weight then you relate
'Cuz you already had a taste of
Hustler's withdrawal
Hustlin's like a drug, it's addictin'
The more you hustle, the more you get addicted
The longer you hustle, the deeper the addiction
If you used to push weight you relate
(It's the hustler's withdrawal)
