Just because I'm losing,
Doesnt mean I'm lost,
Doesn't mean I'll stop
Doesn't mean I will cross
Just because I'm hurting,
Doesnt mean I'm hurt,
Doesnt mean I didn't get what I deserved,
No better and no worse
I just got lost
Every river that I tried to cross,
Every door I ever tried was locked
Oh and Im just waiting til the shine wears off
You might be a big fish
In a little pond,
Doesnt mean youve won
Cause along may come
A bigger one
And youll be lost,
Every river that you tried to cross,
Every gun you ever held went off
Oh and Im just waiting 'til the firing stopped
Oh and Im just waiting til the shine wears off
[Jay-Z]
Aha, I gotcha, uh...
With the same sword they knight you, they gon' good night you with
Shit, that's only half if they like you
That ain't even the half what they might do
Don't believe me? ask Michael
See Martin, see Malcolm
See Biggie, see Pac, see success and its outcome
See Jesus, see Judas
See Caesar, see Brutus, see success is like suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
If you succeed, prepare to be crucified
Media meddles, niggas sue you, you settle
Every step you take, they remind you you ghetto
So it's tough being Bobby Brown
To be Bobby then, you have to be Bobby now
And the question is, is to have had and lost,
Better than not having at all?
Because I'm...
[Chris Martin]
Oh and I, just waiting til the shine wears off
Oh and I, just waiting til the shine wears off
