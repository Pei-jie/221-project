You and I were meant to be
Aint no doubt about it
No way to hide that sort of thing
Not waiting for something better
Aint nothing better worth imagining
I, I keep on running
Im building bridges that I know you never wanted
Look for my heart
You stole it away
Now on every single road that I would take
(REFF.)
Listen, I want you to burn my bridges down
I said, I want you to burn my bridges down
Set me on Fire
You set me
Set me on Fire
You can burn my bridges down
Send this out to sea
Send it where you wanted
You can take it No for no or not at all
Theres no filling up your spaces with fictionary places
Imaginary faces they dont work at all
I, I keep on running
Im building bridges that I know you never wanted
Look for my heart
You stole it away
Now on every single road that I would take
Listen, I want you to burn my bridges down
(REFF.)
I said, I want you to burn my bridges down
Set me on Fire
You set me
Set me on Fire
Girl you burnt my bridges down
I want you to burn my bridges down, down
I want you to burn my bridges down
Set me on fire
You set me
Set me on Fire
Set me on Fire
I want you to burn my bridges down
I said, I want you to burn my bridges down
Down, Down
Set me on fire
Set me on fire
