rock
Do you remember the nights
We'd stay up just laughing
Smiling for hours at anything
Remember the nights
We drove around crazy in love
When the lights go out, we'll be safe and sound
We'll take control of the world
Like it's all we have to hold on to
And we'll be a dream
Do you remember the nights
We made our way dreaming
Hoping of being someone big
We we're so young then
We were too crazy in love
When the lights go out, we'll be safe and sound
We'll take control of the world
Like it's all we have to hold on to
And we'll be a dream
Woah, woah, woah...
Woah, woah, oh...
When the lights go out, we'll be safe and sound
We'll take control of the world
Like it's all we have to hold on to
And we'll be
When the lights go out, we'll be safe and sound
We'll take control of the world
Like it's all we have to hold on to
And we'll be a dream
