My love, there's only you in my life
The only thing that's bright
My first love, you're every breath that I take
You're every step I make
And I
(I, I, I, I, I)
I want to share all my love with you
No one else will do
And your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
They tell me how much you care
Ooh yes, you will always be
My endless love
Two hearts, two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun forever
(Oh)
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms
And love, oh, love
I'll be a fool for you
I'm sure you know I don't mind
Oh, you know I don't mind
'Cause you, you mean the world to me
Oh, I know, I know
I've found in you my endless love
Ooh, wow
Boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Ooh, and love, oh, love
I'll be that fool for you
I'm sure that you know I don't mind
Oh, you know I don't mind
And, yes, you'll be the only one
'Cause no one, no one can deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you
My love, my love, my love
My endless love
