You're breaking my heart tonight
Kissing me hard, see Valentino stars tonight
I just wanna party tonight
We're breaking all the rules, but baby, it all feels so right
You're breaking my heart tonight
Take me for a ride boy, don't leave me on the side, boy.
Hey guy, what you doing, I like you a lot
I been watching you, you watching me, I think you're hot
Gold hoops, cherry pie, I'm the apple of his eye

Hey fly boy, you cruising faster than the light
Bling is shining bright, and you got lightning in your eyes
Gold chains, kissing fly, leaning on your chrome ride
Versailles, Saint Tropez, lingerie and yayo
I know it, I know it

Don't leave me on the side boy

Kissing me hard, see Valentino stars tonight
