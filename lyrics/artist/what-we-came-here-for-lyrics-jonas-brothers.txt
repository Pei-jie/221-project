They say that life is a two-way street
When you're not sure, you gotta trust your feet
To know the right way
You can keep on moving with your head down
Or you can stop and take a look around
And that's the choice I've made
(I've made, yeah)
It's for that movie inside your head
Making memories we can't forget
But when you can't forget
You're gonna know in your soul
This is what we came here for
So live it loud, here and now
This moment, it won't be ignored
So why not open up that door?
It's what we came here for
For every song we let play outside
The melodies we get to write
Every time we sing, oh yeah
The friends we've made, the fun we've had
Remembering's gonna make me laugh
It's a beautiful thing
(So beautiful)
I wanna send it around the world
(Around the world)
'Cause everybody should feel this good
'Cause when you feel this good
You're gonna know in your soul
This is what we came here for
(This is what we came here for)
So live it loud, here and now
This moment, it won't be ignored
So why not open up that door?
It's what we came here for
No, the fun's just getting started
Just celebrating where we are
And loving where we are
You're gonna know in your soul
This is what we came here for
So live it loud, here and now
This moment, it won't be ignored
You're gonna know in your soul
This is what we came here for
So live it loud, here and now
This moment, it won't be ignored
(And we'll )
So why not open up that door?
(Open up that door)
So come on; open up that door
It's what we came here, oh yeah
It's what we came here for
It's what we came here
Came here for
