Ne-Yo
pop
Come on baby and drop it
Scrub that floor and just mop it
Show these gangsters how you pop, lock it
Dont care what you got in your pocket
I get the way that your rocking
Flip that thang thang dont stop it
When i just bang bang and pop
While the club crowded just watch out (work it out )
Got a gang of cash and it's all thrown out on the bar (now work it out)
And it's going fast cuz I feel like a superstar (now work it out)
And you may not have it, I might just broke the law (now work it out)
It's your time to grab it, now make this whole thing yours (now work it out)
Hey, said us hustler's work is never through
We makin' it 'cause we make it move
The only thing we know how to do
Said it's the only thing we know how to do
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard.
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard.
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job
Some pressure that we can push
Ladies can't get enough
Got my fitness, I'm looking buff
And all my people with my trust
Holdin' down for my city
If they askin' you, I'm not guilty
All the thing that I'm guilty of is making you rock with me (work it out)
Got a gang of cash and it's all thrown out on the bar (now work it out)
And it's going fast cuz I feel like a superstar (now work it out)
And you may not have it, I might just broke the law (now work it out)
It's your time to grab it, now make this whole thing yours (now work it out)
Hey, said us hustler's work is never through
We makin' it 'cause we make it move
The only thing we know how to do
Said it's the only thing we know how to do
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard.
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard.
We work hard, play hard
Keep partyin' like it's your job
Hey, said a hustler's work is never through
