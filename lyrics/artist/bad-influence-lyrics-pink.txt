Alright sir, sure, I'll have another one, it's early
Three olives, shake it up, I like it dirty
Tequila for my friend, it makes her flirty
Trust me, I'm the instigator of underwear
Showing up here and there, uh, oh
(Oh, no)
I'm always on a mission from the get go
So what if it's only one o'clock in the afternoon?
It's never too soon to send out all the invitations
To the last night of your life
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy
I can't help it, I like to party
It's dramatic, it's electrifying
Wind me up and watch me go
Where she stops nobody knows
A good excuse to be a bad influence on you
You and you and you and you and you
And you and you and you and you and you
And you and you and you and you and you
Alright, man, calm down
I know your son, said he was at my house
He was the captain of the football team but I turned him out
He wasn't the first and he won't be the last
So tone it down, this happens all the time
I'm the story, the tale, the alibi
They wanna go home, I ask them, why?
It's daylight, not night
It might need a break from all the real life
(Get a life)
Gets to be too much sometimes
It's never too late to send out all the invitations
To the last night of your life
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy
I can't help it, I like to party
It's dramatic, it's electrifying
Wind me up and watch me go
Where she stops nobody knows
A good excuse to be a bad influence on you
You and you and you and you and you and you
(And you)
And you and you and you and you and you
(And you)
And you and you and you and you
I'm off to see the doctor
I hope she has a cure
I hope she makes me better
What does that even mean? We don't know
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy
I can't help it, I like to party
It's dramatic, it's electrifying
Wind me up and watch me go
Where she stops nobody knows
A good excuse to be a bad influence on you
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy
I can't help it, I like to party
It's dramatic, it's electrifying
Wind me up and watch me go
Where she stops nobody knows
A good excuse to be a bad influence on you
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy
I can't help it, I like to party
It's dramatic, it's electrifying
You can wind me up and watch me go
Where she stops nobody knows
A good excuse to be a bad influence on you
(And you)
You and you and you and you and you and you
(I'm a good excuse)
And you and you and you and you and you and you
(To be a bad influence on you)
And you and you and you and you
