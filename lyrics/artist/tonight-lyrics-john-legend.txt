(come on )
come on, let me kiss that
ooh, i know you miss that
whats wrong, let me fix that
twist that
baby, tonights the night i let you know
baby, tonights the night we lose control
baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
tonight ill be the best you ever had
i dont wanna brag, but ill be
the best you ever had
i dont wanna brag, but ill be
the best you ever had
i hit you with the best stroke,
freestlying in the breast stroke
til you blowing cigarette smoke
and now the beds broke
so what we gon do now
f-ck it, round two now
work it out, then we cool down
cool down
baby, tonights the night i let you know
baby, tonights the night we lose control
baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
tonight ill be the best you ever had
i dont wanna brag, but ill be
the best you ever had
i dont wanna brag, but ill be
the best you ever had
[ludacris rap verse]
Luda, Listen
You aint even gotta text me
Knowing me and you got that mental telepathy
Meet me up at the spot, Ill be sending over the chauffeur
Rich nigga bread, stay popping up like a toaster
Nobody come close to me and you together
Step under my umbrella, well make it through any weather
Except when I make it storm, sex in the greatest form
And hibernate under my body and
Yep I keep it warmer than a chinchilla
She know I beat it up like the thriller in Manila
Flying my private jet to villas in Anguilla
Then throw you on a grill, that's
Cause seven days a week youre my 5 course meal
Foreal
baby, tonights the night i let you know
baby, tonights the night we lose control
baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
tonight ill be the best you ever had
i dont wanna brag, but ill be
the best you ever had
i dont wanna brag, but ill be
the best you ever had
