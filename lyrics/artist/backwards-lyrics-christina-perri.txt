Take me backwards, turn me around
I cannot find my balance on the ground
This world is too heavy
For a feather falling quickly
And I wrote your story
But I'm afraid of how it ends
And though my friends are doing well
And I'm still on the mend
I'm going to lay back down
Hope the wind takes me around
I gotta find some courage in this town
'Cause nobody's going to save
Somebody who won't change
I tried to be brave
And nothing's coming easy
And all at once, I feel a little queasy
Oh, but if you lost my remedy
Would you please come and be with me?
It's not like there's much better
But his grasp is as green as mine
I can't say that I'm satisfied 3 thousand miles
From your kiss goodbye
I'm going to lay back down
Hope the wind takes me around
I gotta find some courage in this town
And everybody's afraid
'Cause chances come from change
And everybody's afraid
'Cause chances come from breaking
And chances are you're breaking open
I'm going to lay back down
Hope the wind takes me around
I gotta find some courage in this town
'Cause nobody's going to save
Somebody who won't change
It's time to be brave
