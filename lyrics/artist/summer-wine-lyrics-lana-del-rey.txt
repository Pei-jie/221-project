Strawberries, cherries, and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all this things
...
(Verse 1)
I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled to
A song that I have only sang to just a few
She saw my silver spurs and said Let's pass some time
And I will give to you summer wine
(Oooh summer wine)
(Chorus)
Strawberries, cherries, and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all this things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
(Mmm summer wine)
(Verse 2)
My eyes grew heavy and my lips, they could not speak
I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
She reassured me with an unfamiliar line
And then she gave to me more summer wine
(Mmm summer wine)
(Chorus)
Strawberries, cherries, and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all this things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
(Mmm summer wine)
(Verse 3)
When I woke up the sun was shining in my eyes
My silver spurs were gone, my head felt twice its size
She took my silver spurs, a dollar, and a dime
And left me craving for more summer wine
(Oooh - oh summer wine)
(Chorus)
Strawberries, cherries, and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all this things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
(Mmm summer wine) x3
