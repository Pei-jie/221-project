Coldplay
rock
In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost, oh yeah
I was lost, I was lost
Crossed lines I shouldn't have crossed
I was lost, oh yeah
(Yeah)
How long must you wait for it?
(Yeah)
How long must you pay for it?
(Yeah)
How long must you wait for it?
Oh for it
I was scared, I was scared
Tired and under prepared
But I'll wait for it
If you go, if you go
And leave me down here on my own
Then I'll wait for you
(Yeah)
How long must you wait for it?
(Yeah)
How long must you pay for it?
(Yeah)
How long must you wait for it?
Oh for it
Singing ooh, ooh
Please, please, please
Come back and sing to me, to me, me
Come on and sing it out now, now
Come on and sing it out to me, me
Come back and sing
In my place, in my place
Were lines that I couldn't change
I was lost oh yeah
Oh yeah
