All these changes taking place
It was time I didn't waste
No regrets here to erase, throw them all away
Without you, would I feel?
Without you, would I find someone new?
Without you, now I see what I put you through
When most would fade away
It's my thoughts of you that stayed
There's no place to run to if I lost this view
Without you, would I feel?
Without you, would I find someone new?
Without you, now I see what I put you through
And now there's nothing left I can do
Without you, would I feel?
Without you, would I find someone new?
Without you, now I see what I put you through
And now there's nothing left I can do
