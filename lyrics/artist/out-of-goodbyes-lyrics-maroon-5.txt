rock
Tell me actions speak louder
But there's something about her words that hurt
Closing up and it's so late and
I'm the last one still waiting for you to lock the door
On our way home, I realize
There's some kind of storm
Brewing in his eyes
Only veiled by a thin disguise
Now that I've done my time
I need to move on and I need you to try
'Cause we're out of goodbyes
We're out of goodbyes, out of goodbyes
Never asked you to change
But sadly you don't feel the same about me
I wonder does your man still shudder
When you touch his hand like this man
And on our way home I realize
There's some kind of storm
Brewing in his eyes
Only veiled by a thin disguise
Now that I've done my time
I need to move on and I need you to try
'Cause we're out of goodbyes
(Out of goodbyes)
We're out of goodbyes
(Out of goodbyes)
We're out of goodbyes
(We're out of goodbyes)
