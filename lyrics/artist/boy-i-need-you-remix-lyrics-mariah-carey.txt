I can't help it when I'm not around you
(Boy)
'Cause all I ever seem to do
Is drift away in dreams about you
'Cause when I'm without you
(Boy)
It always seems like
Part of me is missing, baby
Sometimes I don't call like I don't care at all
But secretly, you're the only thing that lifts me up
And makes me smile when I'm unhappy
All you gotta do is call and suddenly
Things don't really seem so bad at all
(Boy)
I need you
(Boy)
Adore you
(Boy)
Gotta have you
(Oh boy)
I wanna feel your touch, this ain't no little crush
So come and get my love, baby anything you want
Feeling you
(Boy)
Fiending for you
(Boy)
Just waiting on you
(Boy)
When I see you
(Oh boy)
I'm gonna wrap you up inside my love
And never let you go boy, never let you go boy
My heart races when my Motorola beeps
Or my cell rings, I just make a wish
And if it's you my whole day changes
'Cause when I know you're thinking of me
(Boy)
Heaven knows suddenly it's not so dismal, baby
Sometimes I don't call like I don't care at all
But secretly, you're the only thing that lifts me up
And makes me smile when I'm unhappy
All you gotta do is call and suddenly
Things don't really seem so bad at all
(Boy)
I need you
(Boy)
Adore you
(Boy)
Gotta have you
(Oh boy)
I wanna feel your touch, this ain't no little crush
So come and get my love, baby anything you want
Feeling you
(Boy)
Fiending for you
(Boy)
Just waiting on you
(Boy)
When I see you
(Oh boy)
I'm gonna wrap you up inside my love
And never let you go boy, never let you go boy
I need you
(What? Who? Uh huh, uh huh)
I wanna feel your touch
(Why wouldn't you)
So come and get my love
(Show me where it's at, now sing)
I need you
(What? Who? Uh huh, uh huh)
I'm gonna wrap you up
(Wrap me up)
And never let you go boy, never let you go boy
(Never let me go, girl)
(Boy)
I need you
(Boy)
Adore you
(Boy)
Gotta have you
(Oh boy)
I wanna feel your touch, this ain't no little crush
So come and get my love, baby anything you want
Feeling you
(Boy)
Fiending for you
(Boy)
Just waiting on you
(Boy)
When I see you
(Oh boy)
I'm gonna wrap you up inside my love
And never let you go boy, never let you go boy
