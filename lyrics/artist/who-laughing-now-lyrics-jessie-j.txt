Mummy, they call me names
They wouldn't let me play
I'd run home, sit and cry almost every day
Hey Jessica, you look like an alien
With green skin, you don't fit in this playpen
Well they pull my hair, they took away my chair
I keep it in and pretend that I didn't care
Hey Jessica, you're so funny
You've got teeth just like Bugs Bunny
Oh, so you think you know me now
Have you forgotten how
You would make me feel?
When you drag my spirit down?
But thank you for the pain
It made me raise my game
And I'm still rising, I'm still rising, yeah
So make your jokes, go for broke
Blow your smoke, you're not alone
But who's laughing now?
But who's laughing now?
So raise the bar, hit me hard
Play your cards, be a star
But who's laughing now?
But who's laughing now?
'Cause I'm in L.A., you think I've made my fame
FB makes us friends when you only really know my name
Oh, Jessie, we knew you could make it
I've got a track and I'd love you to take it
So now because I'm signed, you think my pocket's lined
Four years now and I'm still waiting in the line
Oh, Jessie, I saw you on YouTube
I tagged old photos from when we was at school
Oh, so you think you know me now
Have you forgotten how
You would make me feel
When you drag my spirit down?
But thank you for the pain
It made me raise my game
And I'm still rising, I'm still rising, yeah
So make your jokes, go for broke
Blow your smoke, you're not alone
But who's laughing now?
But who's laughing now?
So raise the bar, hit me hard
Play your cards, be a star
But who's laughing now?
But who's laughing now?
Jessie, she broke out of the box
Swallowed your pride, you got that ego cough
Let the haters hate
You're like way too late
See I got a message from you
Hola, I'm proud of you
"Oh my God, babe, your voice is like wow"
My reply, "Who's laughing now?"
Oh, so you think you know me now
Have you forgotten how
You would make me feel
When you drag my spirit down?
But thank you for the pain
It made me raise my game
And I'm still rising, I'm still rising, yeah
So make your jokes, go for broke
Blow your smoke, you're not alone
But who's laughing now?
But who's laughing now?
So raise the bar, hit me hard
Play your cards, be a star
But who's laughing now?
But who's laughing now?
So make your jokes, go for broke
Blow your smoke, you're not alone
But who's laughing now?
But who's laughing now?
So raise the bar, hit me hard
Play your cards, be a star
But who's laughing now?
Who's laughing, laughing now?
Who's laughing, laughing now?
Who's laughing, laughing now?
Who's laughing, laughing now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Who's laughing, laughing now?
Who's laughing, laughing now?
Who's laughing, laughing now?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
