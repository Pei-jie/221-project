So you're on the prowl wondering whether she left already or not
Leather jacket collar popped like antenna, never knowing when to stop
Sunglasses indoors par for the course, lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles
Call off the search for your soul or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke,
She calls the folks who run this her oldest friends,
Sipping her drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent
Her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem
She's a certified mind blower knowing full well that I don't
I may suggest there's somewhere from which I might know her
Just to get the ball to roll
Drunken monologues, confused because
It's not like I'm falling in love I just want you to do me no good
And you look like you could
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem
The look of love
The rush of blood
The "she's with me"
The Gallic shrug
The shutterbugs
The camera plus
The black and white and the colour dodge
The good time girls
The cubicles
The house of fun
The number one party anthem
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem
Number one party anthem
Number one party anthem
