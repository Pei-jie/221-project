[Intro]
All of the lights (All of the lights)
(Lights, lights)
All of the lights (All of the lights)
[Chorus 1 - Rihanna]
Turn up the lights in here baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights
(All of the lights)
[Bridge - Elly Jackson/La Roux]
Fast cars, shooting stars
(All of the lights, all of the lights)
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are
(All of the lights)
If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life
[Verse 1 - Kanye West]
Something wrong
I hold my head
M.J. gone, our nigga dead!
I slapped my girl, she called the FEDS
I did that time, and spent that bread
I'm headed home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, headed up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university
[Chorus 2 - Kanye West]
(All of the lights)
Cop lights, flash lights, spot lights
Strobe lights, street lights
(All of the lights, all of the lights)
Fast life, drug life
Thug life, Rock life
Every night
(All of the lights)
[Chorus 1]
[Verse 2 - Kanye West]
Restraining order
Can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother, hate me in that order
Public visitation
We met at Borders
Told her she take me back
I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes
I bump my head
Courts sucked me dry
I spent that bread
She need a daddy
Baby please, can't let her grow up in that ghetto university
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 1]
[Verse 3 - Kid Cudi]
Getting mine, baby
Got to let these niggas know, yeah
Get it right, aye
You should go and get your own
Getting mine, baby
Got to let these niggas know, yeah
Get it right, aye
You should go and get your own
[Verse 4 - Fergie]
Unemployment line, credit card declined
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind?
(My mind, my mind, my mind)
And also was about to do that line
Okay, okay, you know we going all the way this time
(This time, this time, this time)
We going all the way this time
(Time, time, time, time)
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
We going all the way this time
[John Legend]
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights
