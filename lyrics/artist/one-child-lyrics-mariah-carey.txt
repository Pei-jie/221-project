An angel appeared of the highest one
And Mary believed the word she received
Of God's only son, The Virgin rejoiced
Gave thanks to the Lord and as Joseph dreamt
The angel was sent with tidings of piece and joy
Of the blessed baby boy
They travelled for miles to reach Bethlehem
Yet when they arrived, no one could provide
Place at the inn for them but God kept them safe
From hurt, harm and danger in His warm embrace
Away in a manger waiting for Jesus' birth
To glorify the earth then He came
One child can change the world
Christmas morn'
The King of all kings was born
He reigns forevermore
Let us worship and adore
Christ the Lord
Wonderous star led shepherds and wise men
Through valleys and mountains angels surrounded them
As they travelled far as Heaven and home
Rang out for the Savior, the sweet Prince of Peace
Lay majestically asleep glorious and pure
And His mercy endures for always
One child can change the world
Christmas morn'
The King of all kings was born
He reigns forevermore
Let us worship and adore
Christ the Lord
One child can change the world
On Christmas morn'
The King of all kings was born
He reigns forevermore
Let us worship him
Let us worship him
Let us worship
Christ the Lord
This angel appeared
The angel appeared
Christ the Lord
On Christmas morn
