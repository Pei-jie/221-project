Coldplay
rock
I stole a key
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
I saw the lights go down and they're standing in front of me
In my scarecrow dream
When they smashed my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete
Be a cartoon heart
Light a fire, light a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart.
We'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark
We'll be glowing in the dark
All the boys, all the girls
All that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls
All the madness that occurs
All the highs, all the lows
As the room is spinning, oh
We'll run riot
We'll be glowing in the dark
So we soar luminescent and wired
We'll be glowing in the dark
