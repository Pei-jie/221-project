Woah woah
When I saw you over there
I didnt mean to stare
But my mind was everywhere
I wanna know you
Girl, I guess that youre the kind
To say whats on your mind
But you listen when I have something to show you
There's a mark above your eye
You got it in July
Your fighting for your sister's reputation
You remember peoples names
And valentine's are lame
So we'll bring flower just for no occasion, oh
Woah woah oh oh
Woah woah
I wanna know you
Woah woah oh oh
Woah woah
I wanna go there where you go
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself
Yeah, I thought so
You smile, never shout
You stand out in a crowd
You make the best of every situation
Correct me if Im wrong
Youre fragile and youre strong
A beautiful and perfect combination
Yeah
Woah woah oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah
Woah woah
I wanna know you
Woah woah oh oh
Woah woah
I wanna go there where you go
I wanna find out what you know
And maybe someday down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself
I like how you are with me
In our future history
And maybe someday down the road
I'll sit back and say to myself
Yeah, I thought so
I thought so
Hu oh oh

I wanna know you (Yeah! Yeah!)
I wanna go there, where you go (Where you go!)

In our future history (Yeah!)
And maybe someday down the road (Yeah!)
I'll sit back and say to myself (Yeah!)
