Paramore
rock
Oh no, I just keep on falling
Back to the same old
And where's hope when misery comes crawling?
Oh my way-ay
With your faith you'll trigger a landslide
(Victory)
And kill off this common sense of mine
It takes acquired minds
To taste, to taste, to taste this wine
You can't down it with your eyes
So we don't need the headlines
We don't need the headlines, we just want
We want the airwaves back
We want the airwaves back
Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now?
Everybody live like it's the last day you will ever see
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now?
Right now, you're the only reason
Im not letting go-o
And I'm out if everyone's worth pleasing
Well ha ha
Youll trigger a landslide
(Victory)
To kill off their finite state of mind
It takes acquired minds
To taste, to taste, to taste this wine
You can't down it with your eyes
So we dont need the headlines
No, we dont want your headlines, we just want
We want the airwaves back
We want the airwaves back
Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now?
Everybody live like it's the last day you will ever see
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now?
Everybody sing like its the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure?
Alright, so you think you're ready?
Okay, then you say this with me, go
We were born for this
We were born for this
Alright, so you think you're ready?
Okay, then you say this with me, go
We were born for this
We were born for this
We were born for this
We were born for this
We were born for
We were born for
Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure?
Everybody live like it's the last day you will ever see
Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure now?
Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure?
Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure?
We were born for this
We were born for this
We were born for this
