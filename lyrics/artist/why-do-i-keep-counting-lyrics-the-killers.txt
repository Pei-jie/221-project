rock
There's a plane and I am flying
There's a mountain waiting for me
Oh these years have been so trying
I don't know if I can use them
Am I strong enough to be the one?
(Am I strong enough to be the one?)
Will I live to have some children?
(Children)
Help me get down, I can make it, help me get down
Help me get down, I can make it, help me get down
If I only knew the answer I wouldn't be bothering you, father
Help me get down, I can make it, help me get down
Help me get down, I can make it, help me get down
If I only knew the answer and if all our days are numbered
Then why do I keep counting?
My sugar's sweet and so attainable
This behavior's so unexplainable
The days just slip and slide like they always did
The trouble is my head won't let me forget
I took one last good look around
(So many unusual sounds)
I gotta get my feet on the ground
Help me get down, I can make it
Help me get down, I can make it, help me get down
Help me get down, I can make it, help me get down
If I only knew the answer I wouldn't be bothering you, father
Help me get down, I can make it, help me get down
Help me get down, I can make it, help me get down
If I only knew the answer and if all our days are numbered
Would you help me get down? I can make it, help me get down
Help me get down I can make it, help me get down
If I only knew the answer
If I change my way of living
And if I pave my streets with good times
Will the mountain keep on giving?
And if all of our days are numbered
Then why do I keep counting?
