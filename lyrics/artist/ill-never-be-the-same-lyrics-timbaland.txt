hiphop
What is somebody like you doing in a place like this?
Say did you come alone or did you bring all your friends?
Say what's your name, what are you drinking
Think I know what are you thinking
Baby whats your sign tell me yours and ill tell you mine
Say what is someone like you doing in a place like this?
[Chorus:]
I'll never be the same if we ever meet again
Won't let you get away
This free fall's got me so
Kiss me all night don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same if we ever meet again
Do you come here much? I swear I've seen your face before
Hope you don't see me blush but I cant help but want you more more
Baby tell me whats your story I ain't shy don't you worry
I'm flirting with my eyes, wanna leave with you tonight
do you come here much? I've gotta see your face some more
(some more cause baby I)
[Chorus]
If we ever meet again
I'll have so much more to say
If we ever meet again
I wont let you go away
If we ever meet again
I'll have so much more to say
If we ever meet again
[Chorus]
This free fall's got me so kiss me so oh
This night , don't ever let me go
I'll never be the same if we ever meet again
