Mamacita, donde esta Santa Claus?
Donde esta Santa Claus?
And the toys that he will leave.
Mamacita, oh, where is Santa Claus?
I look for him because it's Christmas Eve.
I know that I should be the sleeping,
But maybe he's not far away,
So out of the window I'm peeping,
Hoping to see him in his sleigh.
I hope he won't forget to clack his castanets,
And to his reindeer, say,
"Oh Pancho, Oh! Vixen, Oh! Pedro, Oh! Blitzen,"
Ole! Ole! Ole! Cha cha cha!

Alright, Mamacita. I'll go to sleep now.
