Chorus:
I-I-I-I, Im seeking in
You know thats somethings got to
Somethings got you and then you told yourself
You found a modern Mona Lisa, yeah
You gave up all your love
You said fools keeper.
You got no money, it doesnt mean a thing
You got time, the time is everything
We all gonna die, stay away
Listening to the records that you love
Now youre saying:
Chorus:
I-I-I-I, Im seeking in
You know thats somethings got to
Somethings gotta give, uh, uh, uh
And then you showed yourself
And all the colors that you fear, oh, oh, ohhhh
It doesnt mean a thing,
You got love, you got everything
Talk online, stay awake
Listen to records that we love!
Chorus:
I-I-I-I, Im seeking in
You know thats somethings got to
Somethings gotta give
Is gotta give
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Somethings gotta give
Is gotta give, is gotta give
Oh, oh, oh!
