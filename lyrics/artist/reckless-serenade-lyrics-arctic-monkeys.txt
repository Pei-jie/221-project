rock
Topless models
Doing semaphore
Wave their flags
As she walks by and get ignored
Illuminations
On a rainy day
When she walks her footsteps sing
A reckless serenade
I've been trying to figure out
Exactly what it is I need
Call up to listen to the voice of reason
And got the answering machine
The type of kisses
Where teeth collide
When she laughs the heavens hum
A stun gun lullaby
Those twinkling vixens
With the shining spiral eyes
Their hypnosis goes unnoticed
When she's walking by
I've been trying to figure out
Exactly what it is I need
Call up to listen to the voice of reason
And got his answering machine
I left my message
But did he forget back to me?
And now I'm stuck still wondering
How it's meant to be
Singing a reckless serenade, reckless serenade
Reckless serenade, reckless serenade
Reckless serenade, reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
