He grew up in the city, had a lot of money
Sponging off his daddy all the time
He lives in a bubble, never had to struggle
So far from the benefit line
But he feels blue sometimes
And his blood bleeds red like mine
The grass is greener on the other side
What I'm saying is we're all alike
We're the colors of the rainbow, yeah, yeah
