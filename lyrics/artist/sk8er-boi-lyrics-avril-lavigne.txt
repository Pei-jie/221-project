Avril%20Lavigne
pop
He was a boy, she was a girl
Can I make it anymore obvious?
He was a punk, she did ballet
What more can I say?
He wanted her, she'd never tell
Secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends stuck up their nose
And they had a problem with his baggy clothes
He was a sk8ter boi, she said, "See ya later boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face but her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth
Five years from now, she sits at home
Feeding the baby, she's all alone
She turns on TV, guess who she sees
Sk8ter boi rockin' up MTV
She calls up her friends, they already know
And they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along and stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down
He was a sk8ter boi, she said, "See ya later boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar, slamin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
He was a sk8ter boi, she said, "See ya later boy"
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a superstar, slamin' on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?
Sorry girl, but you missed out
Well, tough luck that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see
See the man that boy could be
There is more than meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside
He's just a boy and I'm just a girl
Can I make it anymore obvious?
We are in love, haven't you heard
How we rock each others world?
I'm with the sk8ter boi, I said, "See ya later boy"
I'll be backstage after the show
I'll be at his studio, singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know
I'm with the sk8ter boi, I said, "See ya later boy"
I'll be backstage after that show
I'll be at the studio, singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know
