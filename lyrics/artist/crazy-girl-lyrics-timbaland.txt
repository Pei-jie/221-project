Hey baby, chill out, chill out, chill out
Hey baby, chill out, chill out
Girl didn't change, wake up in the morning
I'm already knowing
Ain't no telling what you might do, (do)
When I'm gone, (gone)
You give me that crazy tone, (tone)
And you want to know why I want to get so far away from you, (you)
I guess its safe to say the thrill is gone, (gone, gone, gone)
You think you normal but that's not true, (not true)
It would be best if I left you alone, (alone, alone, alone)
I think your head is missing some screws, (some screws)
I used to think I want that, (want that)
But now I am saying bump that, (bump that)
All the time I want that, (want that)
So baby I am going to fall back and tell you, tell you
I've seen a lot of things but I never seen (hey)
I never seen a girl as crazy as you
Seen a lot of crazy places some mixed up crazy faces (hey)
But I've never seen a girl as crazy as you
Now what is it this time
You must have lost your mind
Wish I could press rewind
Tryin' to figure out what did I do
I have seen a lot of things but
I've never seen (hey)
I've never has seen a girl as crazy as you, you, you, as you, as you
I've never has seen a girl as crazy as you, you, you, as you, as you
I've never has seen a girl as crazy as you
Hey baby, (hey baby) you're not wanted here
You can dry those fake tears up my dear, (dear)
We both know that your head ain't right, (right)
I wake up and you standing over me while I sleep at night (night, night, night)
Now tell me what you are going to tell our friends, (friends)
When I change those locks and you can't get in, (in)
Ain't willin' to talk so I'm singing this song, (song)
And I don't need a doctor to tell me you're gone, (gone)
And happens every time every thing you say you lie
Time after time I try
And I just don't need it no more (no mo')
You on the other side
Those schizophrenic eyes
Just made me realize that
I gotta tell ya, (tell ya)
I've seen a lot of things but I never seen (hey)
I never seen a girl as crazy as you
Seen a lot of crazy places some mixed up crazy faces (hey)
But I've never seen a girl as crazy as you
Now what is it this time
You must have lost your mind
Wish I could press rewind
Tryin' to figure out what did I do
I have seen a lot of things but
I've never seen (hey)
I've never has seen a girl as crazy as you, you, you, as you, as you
I've never has seen a girl as crazy as you, you, you, as you, as you
I've never has seen a girl as crazy as you
Shit, she took the key to the driver's side door of my car, (my car, my car)
Just because she said she had a dream, (dream)
That she saw me, (me) with some other broad, (broad)
And now I am standing on the front lawn
Gun in my hand damn how did this shit get this far, (this far, this far, this far)
Baby you could fool the whole world, (world) but I know who you really are, (are)
And I have never seen a girl as crazy as you
I've seen a lot of things but I never seen (hey)
I never seen a girl as crazy as you
Seen a lot of crazy places some mixed up crazy faces (hey)
But I've never seen a girl as crazy as you
Now what is it this time
You must have lost your mind
Wish I could press rewind
Tryin' to figure out what did I do
I have seen a lot of things but
I've never seen (hey)
I've never has seen a girl as crazy as you, you, you, as you, as you
I've never has seen a girl as crazy as you, you, you, as you, as you
I've never has seen a girl as crazy as you
