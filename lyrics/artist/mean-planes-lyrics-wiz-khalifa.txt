hiphop
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You, have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like a nothing (3x)
Screamin fuck them niggas who hated, I'm money affiliated
Speculating me landing, must of got me mistaken with lame nigga's
Know you gone get high as fuck as long as the planes with ya
Left that major situation alone and became richer
People talkin' down but see me I'm the same nigga
Leave yo bitch around we gone drink the champagne wit her
We don't touch the ground see a cloud with my name it,
Only ez-widers, please no cigars for me and my gang
Fool I'm a legend in these streets cause how I do my thang
And Don't wear the fitted, I got the city on my chain
Oh, man still they hate and talk smack, knowing if I was gone there be no throne to throw ya rocks at
Cruise at maximum altitudes I'm tryna top that
So in touch with the real them suckas tryna stop that
But I, live or let die, party get high
And tell them lames to the plane or let fly
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You, have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like a nothing (3x)
Uh, stuck alone in this wave race
Say I'm living to fast, don't plan on changing my pace
Got one foot on the gas, there's never a need for brakes
Smoke ez-wider's with hash, fuck bitches from out of state
Valet bringing my cars, a waiter to bring me plates
Shrimp and fillet Mignon, we celebrate buying drinks
Wit a couple of broads, my nigga's and who got love for me
It's lonely at the top, I'm tired of having company
Uh, so while you busy trying to fit in, Imma stand out
And view my life through this lens to see how it pan's out
Substitute teacher ass nigga's, need a handout
Middle finger screaming fuck them nigga's who hated,
I'm money affiliated
Pop another bottle, that chronic smokin degraded
Speculating me landing must of got me mistaken,
I'm speaking as the captain of the plane,
You's a runner on the jet way
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You, have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like a nothing (5x)
