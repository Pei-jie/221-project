Can anybody help me? I'm outta plans
Guess I left my world in somebody's hands
I don't like to hurt but, but everyone gets weak
Someone to rely on that's what I really need
Now here we stay, it's all that we're worth
I've been through the pain and been dragged through the dirt
Whatever they tell you were bigger than words
I've been where you're standing, I know how it hurts
Let this be a song now and this be our day
And we stand together, we'll be okay
'Cause we're survivors, we're making it work
Expecting the best when they hope for the worst
One love, this is the way we found
One love, even though they'll let you down
One love, nobody's perfect now
One love, don't let that hold you down
One love, let's stick together now
One love, we got to stand our ground
One love, it's easy to believe in
One love, believe in you and me, one love
Now I could try and fix this all by myself
But I know it'd turn out better if you help
No one likes to hurt but, but everyone gets weak
Someone to rely on that's what everybody needs
Now here we stay, it's all that we're worth
I've been through the pain and been dragged through the dirt
Whatever they tell you were bigger than words
I've been where you're standing, I know how it hurts
Let this be a song now and this be our day
And we stand together we'll be okay
'Cause we're survivors, we're making it work
Expecting the best when they hope for the worst
One love, this is the way we found
One love, even though they'll let you down
One love, nobody's perfect now
One love, don't let that hold you down
One love, let's stick together now
One love, we got to stand our ground
One love, it's easy to believe in
One love, believe in you and me
One love, it's one love
I'm here to tell you it's one love, oh
One love, said it's one love, sing with me one love
One love to be, oh, one love, that's all we need, one love
