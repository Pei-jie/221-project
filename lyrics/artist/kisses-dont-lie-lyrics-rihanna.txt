Kisses don't, no they don't, never don't lie
You can run if you want but you can't hide
Telling you it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't, no they don't, kisses don't lie
Emotions come and go, who knows how the wind will blow
There's so little in this world to trust in
Seduce themselves with lies, some don't realize
They call it love but it's really only lustin', yeah
So you see, you and me
We're getting close to danger zone
Show me how, tell me now, should I stay or should I go
'Cause I'm caught between yes and no
'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I been missing
I try to slow down but my heart won't listen
And it's tearing me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in
I try to run but there's no place to hide 'cause baby kisses don't lie
Kisses don't, no they don't, never don't lie
You can run if you want but you can't hide
Telling you it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't, no they don't, kisses don't lie
You whisper in my ear but are your words sincere
'Cause pretty words can cut just like a knife
You see I'm nobody's fool, I play by my own rules
So please think twice before you step into my life
So you see, you and me
We're getting close to danger zone
Show me how, tell me now, should I stay or should I go
'Cause I'm caught between yes and no
'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I been missing
I try to slow down but my heart won't listen
And it's tearing me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in
I try to run but there's no place to hide 'cause baby kisses don't lie
Kisses don't, no they don't, never don't lie
You can run if you want but you can't hide
Telling you it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't, no they don't, kisses don't lie
Kisses don't, no they don't, never don't lie
You can run if you want but you can't hide
Telling you it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't, no they don't, kisses don't lie
So you see, you and me
We're getting close to danger zone
Show me how, tell me now, should I stay or should I go
'Cause I'm caught between yes and no
'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I been missing
I try to slow down but my heart won't listen
And it's tearing me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in somethin' I don't trust in
I try to run but there's no place to hide 'cause baby kisses don't lie
Kisses don't, no they don't, never don't lie
You can run if you want but you can't hide
Telling you it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't, no they don't, kisses don't lie
