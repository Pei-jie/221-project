(Verse)
I wish I could stop myself
You can't tell me theres nothing there (nothing there)
I dont want nobody else
Hoping one day you might care (yea yea yea)
(Pre-Chorus)
Voices saying just hold back
And erase the heart drawn on your sleeve (your sleeve)
I wont stop pushin pushin for your love baby (huh)
Look what you done to me
(Chorus)
You got me daydreamin
Thats all I got, all I got
Daydreamin
Of what I want, what I want
Daydreamin
Thats all I got, all I got
I dont wanna know, I dont wanna know know
I dont wanna know, I dont wanna know know
(Verse)
Imagination running wild (running wild!)
I need to realize this aint real (real real real)
Please just hit me with the truth (truth)
It won't hurt if its how I feel (how I feel)
(Pre-Chorus)
Voices saying just hold back
And erase the heart drawn on your sleeve (your sleeve)
I wont stop pushin pushin for your love baby
I want you here with me
(Chorus)
You got me daydreamin
Thats all I got, all I got
Daydreamin
Of what I want, what I want
Daydreamin
Thats all I got, all I got
I dont wanna know, I dont wanna know know
I dont wanna know, I dont wanna know know
(Bridge)
I'm floating even though i'm wide awake
Im floatin, Im floatin
You give me bliss and i just can't escape
Oh oh oh!
(Chorus x2)
You got me daydreamin
Thats all I got, all I got
Daydreamin
Of what I want, what I want
Daydreamin
Thats all I got, all I got
I dont wanna know, I dont wanna know know
I dont wanna know, I dont wanna know know
