rock
Shaking like the devil when she lets me go
Got a new place and how it's so much better
Falling over myself, the television's on
I turn it off and smile
Oh Jennifer, you know I always tried
Before you say goodbye
Leave the bourbon on the shelf
And I'll drink it by myself
And I love you endlessly
Darling, don't you see
I'm not satisfied until I hold you tight?
Give me one more chance tonight
And I swear I'll make it right
But you ain't got time for this
And that wrecking bell is ringing
And I'm not satisfied until I hold you
Jennifer, tell me where I stand
And who's that other boy holding your hand?
Oh Jennifer, you know I've always tried
Before you say goodbye
Leave the bourbon on the shelf
And I'll drink it by myself
And I never liked your hair
Or those people that you lie with
And I'm not satisfied until I hold you tight
And I love you endlessly
Darling, don't you see
I can't be satisfied until I hold you tight?
Leave the bourbon on the shelf
And I'll drink it by myself
And I love you endlessly
Darling, don't you see, I'm not satisfied?
