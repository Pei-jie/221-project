i really hate to let this moment go
touching your skin and your hair falling slow
when a goodbye kiss, feels like this
Chorus:
don't you wanna stay here a little while
don't you wanna hold each other tight
don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight
don't you wanna stay here a little while
we can make forever feel this way
don't you wanna stay
lets take it slow i don't want to move to fast
i don't wanna just make love, i wanna make love last
when your up this high, it's a sad goodbye
don't you wanna stay here a little while
don't you wanna hold each other tight
don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight
don't you wanna stay here a little while
we can make forever feel this way
don't you wanna stay
oh yeah!!!
oh you feel so perfect baby..
don't you wanna stay here a little while..
(Repeat Chorus)
Don't you wanna stay..
yeah yeah yeahhh
yeah yeah yeahhh
