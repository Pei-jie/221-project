Walking around head full of sound
Acting like we don't exist
Walk in a room stare out through you
Talking like we don't exist
But we exist
Daddy it's true, I'm different from you
But tell me why they treat me like this?
You turn away, what could I say
Not the first betrayed by a kiss
Maybe it's true
They're staring at you
When you walk in a room
Turn on us fine
Stare if you like
Or just let us through
Just let us through
Down on your knees
Begging us please
Praying that we don't exist
Daddy it's fine, I'm used to them now
But tell me why they treat me like this?
Is it because we do it like this?
Maybe it's true
They're staring at you
When you walk in a room
Turn on us fine
Stare if you like
Or just let us through
Just let us through
Let them stare
Let them stare
That's all right with you
But lose my heart
If it turn away from you
Daddy told him to wait
Mother, I'm so scared
But will you watch us drown?
You know that they will
You know that we're young
You know that we're confused
But will you watch us drown?
What are you so afraid to lose?
Down on their knees
Begging us please
Praying that we don't exist
We exist
