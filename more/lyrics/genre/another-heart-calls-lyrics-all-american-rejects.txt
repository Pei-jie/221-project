Do you remember when we didn't care?
We were just two kids that took the moment when it was there
Do you remember you at all?
Another heart calls
Yeah, I remember when we stole the night
We'd lie awake but dreaming 'til the sun would wash the sky
Just as soon as I'd see you, but didn't I, but didn't I tell you?
As deep as I need you, you wanna leave it all
What can I do? Say it's true
Or everything that matters breaks in two
Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you
Talk to me, I'm throwing myself in front of you
This could be the last mistake that I would ever wanna do
Yeah, all I ever do is give, it's time you see my point of view
Just as soon as I'd see you, but didn't I, but didn't I tell you?
As deep as I need you, you wanna leave it all
What can I do? Say it's true
Or everything that matters breaks in two
Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you
But I know what you want is to figure it out
And god knows I do too
What can I do? Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you
I'm sorry, so what!
But you don't think I've said enough
I'm sorry, I don't care!
You were never there
Just as soon as I see you but didn't I, but didn't I tell you?
As deep as I need you, you wanna leave it all
What can I do? Say it's true
Or everything that matters breaks in two
Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you
I know what you want is to figure it out
And god knows I do too
Yeah, what can I do? Say it's true
I'll never ask for anyone but you
I'll never ask for anyone but you
I'll never ask for anyone but you
I'll never ask for anyone but you
I'll never ask for anyone but you
I'll never ask for anyone but you
