Female
(Bitch)
You know my name and the company I own
(Bitch)
You like my style and you smell my cologne
(Bitch)
Don't try to act like my track record ain't known
(Bitch)
You probably got a couple CD's in your home
(Bitch, bitch)

And also diddy like, like, like

(Bitch)
I ain't no ball player, you ain't gonna get pregnant again
Hit off with paper, you gonna get hit off and slid off
Before the neighbors take off to go to work
So just, take off your shirt, don't hit me with that church shit
(Bitch)
I got a sister who schooled me to shit you chickens do, trickin' fools
Got a whole Robin Givens crew that I kick it to
They be hippin' dudes, how you chickens move, I be listenin' to
(Bitch, bitch, bitch)

Let's describe a certain female

(Say Jay-Z, why you gotta go and disrespect the women for, huh?)
(Bitch)
Sisters get respect, bitches get what they deserve
Sisters work hard, bitches work your nerves
Sisters hold you down, bitches hold you up
Sisters help you progress, bitches will slow you up
Sisters cook up a meal, play their role with the kids
Bitches in the street with their nose in your biz
Sisters tell the truth, bitches tell lies
Sisters drive cars, bitches wanna ride
Sisters give-up the ass, bitches give up the ass
Sisters do it slow, bitches do it fast
Sisters do their dirt outside of where they live
Bitches have niggers all up in your crib
Sisters tell you quick, "You better check your homie"
Bitches don't give a fuck, they wanna check for your homie
Sisters love Jay 'cuz they know how hov is
I love my sisters, I don't love no bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch
Bitch, bitch, bitch
