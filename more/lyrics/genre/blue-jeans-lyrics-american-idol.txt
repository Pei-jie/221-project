American%20Idol
pop
Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room you know you made my eyes burn
It was like, James Dean, for sure
You're so fresh to death & sick as cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favourite sweater and I know
That love is mean, and love hurts
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby!
I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember
I will love you till the end of time
Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like - no please, stay here, we don't need no money, we could make it all work
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stay up waitin', anticipatin', and pacing' but he was chasing paper
Caught up in the game - that was the last I heard
I will love you till the end of time I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember
Oh baby who I will love you till the end of time
You went out every night
And baby that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did I'd be by your side
'Cause imma ride or die
Whether you fail or fly
Well shit at least you tried
But when you walked out that door a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more, but that's not what I had in mind
Just want it like before
We were dancin' all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember...
I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember
I will love you till the end of time
