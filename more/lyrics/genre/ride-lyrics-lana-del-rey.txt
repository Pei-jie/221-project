I've been out on that open road
You can be my full time, daddy
White and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
You can be my full time, baby
Hot or cold
Don't break me down
I've been traveling too long
I've been trying too hard
With one pretty song
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone in midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride, I just ride
I just ride, I just ride
Dying young and I'm playing hard
That's the way my father made his life an art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it, ride 'til dark
Don't leave me now
Don't say goodbye
Don't turn around
Leave me high and dry
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone in the night
I'm trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, I just ride
I just ride, I just ride
I'm tired of feeling like I'm f*cking crazy
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes
All I got to keep myself sane, baby
So I just ride, I just ride
I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone in the night
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, I just ride
I just ride, I just ride
