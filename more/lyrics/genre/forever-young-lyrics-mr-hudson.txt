Let's dance in style, lets dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you going to drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever
Some are like water, some are like the heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young
It's so hard getting older without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth is like diamonds in the sun
and diamonds are forever young
Forever young, I want to be forever young (forever young)
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young (forever young)
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young (forever young)
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever young (forever young)
