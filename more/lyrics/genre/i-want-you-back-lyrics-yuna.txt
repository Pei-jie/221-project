I'm still up it's 4AM,
I don't know what to make of today
If I'm doing something right,
Why does every bone inside of me ache
I don't know if I'm worth it,
Maybe we were perfect
I really need to call you tonight
Cause I just thought I should let you know
I want you back
Feeling like I did something wrong
I want you back
It's giving you a heartattack
I hate myself for doing that
You're the best thing I ever known
Hey, I've been going back anf forth
Then I miss you more and more everyday
I keep writing all these words,
In my head so I know what to say
I don't know if I'm worth it,
Maybe we were perfect
I really need to call you tonight
Cause I just thought I should let you know
I want you back
Feeling like I did something wrong
I want you back
It's giving you a heartattack
I hate myself for doing that
You're the best thing I ever known
Close my eyes and hold my breath
Hoping that we pass this test
Trying to believe that it's not over
Don't know why I couldn't see
You're the only one for me
I don't really want this to be over
Cause I just thought I should let you know
I want you back
Feeling like I did something wrong
I want you back
It's giving you a heartattack
I hate myself for doing that
You're the best thing I ever known
