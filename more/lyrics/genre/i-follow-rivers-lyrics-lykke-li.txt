Oh, I beg you, can I follow?
Oh, I ask you, wanna always
Be the ocean, where I unravel
Be my only, be the water where I'm wading
You're my river running high, run deep, run wild
Refrain:
I, I follow, I follow you
Deep sea baby, I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you
Dark room honey, I follow you
Heed a message, I'm the runner
He's the rebel, I'm the daughter waiting for you
You're my river running high, run deep, run wild
Refrain:
I, I follow, I follow you
Deep sea baby, I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you
Dark room honey, I follow you
You're my river running high, run deep, run wild
Refrain 2x:
I, I follow, I follow you
Deep sea baby, I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you
Dark room honey, I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you
Deep sea baby, I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you
Dark room honey, I follow you
