blues
Rising with the morning sun
We'll be surfing till the evening comes
Watching the sets roll in
Grab our boards and paddle again
Sitting with the doc' on the bay
Watching the waves roll our away
I'm just sitting with the doc' on the bay
Passin the time...
Left our homes in Cali
To find a better place to play
Got everything to live for
Retirement finally came our way
So I'm just
Surfing with the doc' on the bay
Riding the waves into the day
I'm just surfin with the doc' on the bay
Passin the time...
Hope that nothing's gonna change
Healthy livin keeps us in the game
Can't think what I'd rather do
So I guess I'll remain the same
Three thousand miles I'll roam
To meet Heather and enjoy your new home
Sharing stories and resting our bones
We know our passions won't leave us alone
So now, we're just
Sitting by a fire on the bay
Watching the day fade away
Making plans for the next day
Passing time, no better way
(Whistle)
