Verse 1:
Was 27 surviving my return of Saturn
A long vacation didn't sound so bad
Was full of secrets locked and tied like iron mountain
Running on empty so out of gas
Bridge 1:
Thought I wasn't enough
found I wasn't so tough
Laying on the bathroom floor
We were living on a fault line
and I felt the fault was all mine
Couldn't take it anymore
Chorus:
By the grace of God
(There was no other way)
I picked myself back up
(I knew I had to stay)
I put one foot in front of the other and I
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way
Verse 2:
I thank my sister for keeping my head above the water
When the truth was like swallowing sand
Now, every morning,I hope there is no more mourning
Oh, I can finally see myself again
Bridge 2:
I know I am enough, possible to be loved
It was not about me
Now I have to rise above
Let the universe call the bluff
Yeah, the truth will set you free
Chorus:
By the grace of God
(There was no other way)
I picked myself back up
(I knew I had to stay)
I put one foot in front of the other and I
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way
Coda:
That way, no, that way no
not in the name, in the name of love
that way, no, that way, no
I am not giving up
Chorus:
By the grace of God
I picked myself back up
I put one foot in front of the other and
I looked in the mirror
(looked in the mirror)
looked in the mirror
(looked in the mirror)
Chorus:
By the grace of God
(There was no other way)
I picked myself back up
(I knew I had to stay)
I put one foot in front of the other and I
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay
Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way
