Some people say that rappers don't have feelings
We have feelings, we have feelings
Some people say that we are not rappers
We're rappers
That hurts our feelings
Hurts our feelings when you say we're not rappers
Some people say that rappers are invincible
We're vincible, we're vincible
What you are about to hear are true stories
Real experiences, autobiographical raps
Things that happened to us, all true
Bring the rhyme
I make a meal for my friends, try to make it delicious
Try to keep it nutritious, create wonderful dishes
Not one of them thinks about the way I feel
Nobody compliments the meal
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
I feel like a prized asshole, no one even mentions my casserole
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
You could've said something nice about my profiteroles
Here's a little story to bring a tear to your eye
I was shopping for a wetsuit to scuba dive
But every suit I tried is too big around the thighs
And the assistant suggested I try a ladies' size
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
I'm not gonna wear a ladies' wetsuit I'm a man
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
Get me a small man's wetsuit please
It's my birthday 2003, waitin' for a call from my family
They forgot about me
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
The day after my birthday is not my birthday, mum
I call my friends and say let's go into town
But they're all too busy to go into town
So I go by myself, I go into town
Then I see all my friends they're all in town
I got hurt feelings, I got hurt feelings
They're all lined up to watch that movie ' Maid in Manhattan'
Have you even been told that your ass is too big?
Have you ever been asked if your hair is a wig?
Have you ever been told you're mediocre in bed?
Have you ever been told you've got a weird shaped head?
Has your family ever forgotten you and driven away?
Once again, they forgot about J
Were you ever called homo 'cause at school you took drama?
Have you ever been told that you look like a llama?
Tears of a rapper, tears of a rapper
I'm crying tears of a rapper, tears of a rapper
