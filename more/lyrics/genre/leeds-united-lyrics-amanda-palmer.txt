We watch you
Your expert double exes
It's just like you
To paint those whiter fences
It's so polite, it's so polite
It's offensive, it's offensive
It's so unright, it's so unright
It's a technical, accept it
But who needs love when there's Law And Order?
And who needs love when there's Southern Comfort?
And who needs love at all?
We stalk you
Your expert, double exes
We oxidized you in your sleep
There's no exit, there's no exit
You're on a roll, you're on a roll
No one gets it, no one gets it
Your honor, no, your honor
Can't you protect us? Protect us
But who needs love when there's Law And Order?
And who needs love when there's Southern Comfort?
And who needs love when the sandwiches are wicked
And they know you at the Mac Store?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, I'm so excited
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, the blacks and beat kids
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, I'm getting frightened
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Someday, someday Leeds United
La ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
Ba, da da, da, da
Da da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da da, da
Bugsy Malone came to carry you home
And they're taking you all to the doctor
Verbally vices, all sugary and spices
It's nice but it's not what I'm after
Sure, I admire you, sure, you inspire me
But you've been not getting back so
I'll wait at the Sainsbury's, counting my change
Making bank on the upcoming roster
And we'll stop you
Your expert double exes
Oh yeah, big stack hold of extra care
Two exes, oh, oh, oh
That never talking thing you do
Is effective, it's effective
And your shoulder's icy cold
Oh, than a death wish, than a death wish
But who needs love when there's Law And Order?
And who needs love when there's Dukes Of Hazzard?
And who needs love when the sandwiches are wicked
And they know you at the Mac Store?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm so excited
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The blacks and beat kids
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm so excited
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
When I think about Leeds United
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ouch, I'm getting frightened
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The blacks, the blacks, the blacks and beat kids
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's so exciting
Someday, someday, someday, someday
Someday, someday Leeds United
