Eat, Sleep, and breathe it,
you're full of the stuff
Go bag it, tie it up tight
Wheat-meat-dairy-free, teetotal, happy clappy
High on life, you should try it, try it, you know
Go on while no one's looking.
A-ha! Gotcha now!
Caught you red handed in the biscuit tin!
Cost you to keep me quiet!
Golden boy boots, Pocket pedestal
Picking sharp smart moves
Plastic, tin can, paper separator
Busy bee wave, wave save the planet flag
But sneaky in suburbia
A-ha! Candid Camera
Hook, line and sinker
For the four-wheel drive
Cost you to keep me quiet!
Keep me quiet!
(Keep me quiet!)
Nicest, sweetest,
Utmost in everything
So charming, very charming
Well read, can play the fool, no one's ill at ease
and put their deepest swiss bank trust in you
No one saw it coming
Aaaha! Aaaaaaha! Aaaaaaaaaha!
You killed a man
Cost you to keep me quiet!
