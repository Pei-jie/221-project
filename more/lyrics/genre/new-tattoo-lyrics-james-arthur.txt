Under my skin, beneath my fingertips
You slip and slide away
Let me begin to understand how you operate in such a calculated way
Before today, I didn't know if I'd make it
But now it's all making sense
Yeah, yeah
I wear you like a new tattoo
The design, the desire, I don't wanna remove
You're the kind of thing that I could love forever
I wear it like a new tattoo
And I'll be so happy that I'm stuck with you
And we cannot deface in any weather
Da, da, da, da
And do you ever look in the mirror
Oh, and not know who you are, or know where you going
Oh, and before today
I didn't know if I'd make it
But now it's all making sense
Yeah, yeah
I wear you like a new tattoo
The design, the desire, I don't wanna remove
You're the kind of thing that I could love forever
I wear it like a new tattoo
And I'll be so happy that I'm stuck with you
And we cannot deface in any weather, any weather, any weather
And I was so lost, and I was so lost, in this world
With no place, and no purpose, no
Blowing up, and I will get bigger, never high
Run a fire, the harder we'll love
I wear you like a new tattoo
And I'll be so happy that I'm stuck with you
And we cannot deface in any weather
I wear you like a new tattoo
And I'll be so happy that I'm stuck with you
And we cannot deface in any weather
Any weather, any weather, any weather
