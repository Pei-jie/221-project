Waste all your time writing love songs, but you don't love me
All too familiar when it feels wrong
I think you're just lonely
Do you mind?
I found another new way to look at
Use your time to pack away your every verse and every rhyme
Forget - all the words that let you break my heart
Forget - that I'm the person tearing you apart
Remember way back when you played me
and I lost that hand
So please don't try serenade me
I am a one man band
Say goodbye
Don't need to hear you play
So many other ways to lie
So pack away your every verse and every rhyme
Forget - all the words that let you break my heart
Forget - that I'm the person tearing you apart
I think it's time for me to leave
I gave this piece of mind for free
So if you heed my sound advice, there is no need to tell you twice
There is no need to tell you twice
Forget - all the words that let you break my heart
Forget - that I'm the person tearing you apart
Forget - all the words that let you break my heart
Forget - that I'm the person tearing you apart
So if you heed my sound advice, there is no need to tell you twice
So if you heed my sound advice, there is no need to tell you twice
