Timeflies
pop
Tell me girl could ride with the top gone
Could you come and and keep me up all night long
Could you go and make it pop like a pop song
And if it gets a little rough, could you hold on, hold on
If you're looking for trouble then I could provide
I'm already undressing you with my eyes
Feeling your body, rolling like the tide
So baby what I need tonight is for you to just
Say-ay-ay
That you're down to roll
Now we're staying up late
Cause you already know
Like, oh
When the lights get turned down low
Wanna see you lose control
I just need to know that
Baby you could ride with me
Like, oh
Cause tonight we won't let go
And the world won't be so cold
I just need to know that
Baby you could ride with me
Baby you could ride
Baby you could ride
Baby you could ride with me
Show me you could hold it down when I'm on the road
Yeah, take a naked pic send it to my phone
Treat me like the f*cking man when I come home
Lemme make up for the nights you was all alone
So come on yeah
Give it tome like you should
I'll be bad if you're good
Let me take you for a ride
Through the hills of hollywood
Floor seats private beach sh?t I probably could
So all I need tonight is for you to just
Say-ay-ay
That you're down to roll
Now we're staying up late
Cause you already know
Like, oh
When the lights get turned down low
Wanna see you lose control
I just need to know that
Baby you could ride with me
Like, oh
Cause tonight we won't let go
And the world won't be so cold
I just need to know that
Baby you could ride with me
Turn the lights down low
So you can barely see
I just gotta know that you could ride with me
We could lose control
The only thing I need is you to let me know that you could ride with me
Say-ay-ay
That you're down to roll
Now we're staying up late
Cause you already know
Like, oh
When the lights get turned down low
Wanna see you lose control
I just need to know that
Baby you could ride with me
Like, oh
When the lights get turned down low
Wanna see you lose control
I just need to know that
Baby you could ride with me
Like, oh
Cause tonight we won't let go
And the world won't be so cold
I just need to know that
Baby you could ride with me
Baby you could ride
Baby you could ride
Baby you could ride with me
