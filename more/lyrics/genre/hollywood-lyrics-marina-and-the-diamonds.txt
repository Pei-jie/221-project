American queen is the American dream
American queen is the American dream
She is a Polish girl in America
Tall, tanned, hot, blonde called Anya
I asked her, "Why would you wanna be a hollywood wife?"
"Because, I don't want to end up living in a dive on Vine"
You do anything for a dime
Looking for the golden lie
Hollywood infected your brain
You wanted kissing in the rain, oh oh
Living in a movie scene
Puking American dreams, oh, oh
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America
I fight security making plays for me
Soon as I touch down in old L.A.
He said, "Oh my god, you look just like Shakira!
No no, you're Catherine Zeta"
Actually, my name's Marina
Your mind is just like mine
All filled up with things benign
You're looking for the golden lie
Hollywood infected your brain
You wanted kissing in the rain, oh oh
I've been living in a movie scene
Puking American dreams, oh, oh
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America
American dream is the American queen
American queen is the American dream
Is the American dream
Hollywood infected your brain
You wanted kissing in the rain, oh oh
I've been living in a movie scene
Puking American dreams, oh, oh
Hollywood infected your brain
You wanted kissing in the rain, oh oh
I've been living in a movie scene
Puking American dreams, oh, oh
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America
