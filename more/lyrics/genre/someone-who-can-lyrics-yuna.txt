Excuses are overrated
Apology not accepted
When I catch you with someone else
Stop victimizing yourself
When you want someone to hold onto
I won't be there
When you want someone to lie to
I won't be there
Somebody will always understand
Somebody will always care
You didn't really play your part well
I'll find someone who can
Somebody is gonna love me
And I'm gonna love them back
You didn't really play your part well
I'll find someone who can
She doesn't know who you are
Too young to understand
And you don't even know what you want
And I've given you everything
So when you want someone to love you
I won't be there
When you cry alone in your room
I won't be there
Somebody will always understand
Somebody will always care
You didn't really play your part well
I'll find someone who can
Somebody is gonna love me
And I'm gonna love them back
You didn't really play your part well
I'll find someone who can
I'll find someone who can
I don't wanna feel this again
I don't wanna feel all this pain
I don't wanna feel this heartbreak
I just wanna get on this plane
Somebody is gonna love me
(Somebody is gonna love me)
And I'm gonna love them back
(And I'm gonna love them back)
You didn't really play your part well
I'll find someone who can
Somebody is gonna love me
(Somebody is gonna love me)
And I'm gonna love them back
(And I'm gonna love them back)
You didn't really play your part well
I'll find someone who can
