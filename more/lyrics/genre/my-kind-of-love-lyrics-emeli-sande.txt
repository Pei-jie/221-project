I can't buy your love
Don't even wanna try.
Sometimes the truth won't make you happy,
Still I'm not gonna lie.
I don't ever question if my heart beats only for you, it beats only for you.
I know i'm far from perfect,
Nothin' like your entourage.
I can't grant you any wishes,
I won't promise you the stars.
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you, it beats only for you.
Cause when you've given up,
When no matter what you do it's never good enough.
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough,
That's when you feel my kind of love.
And when you're crying out.
When you fall and then can't pick your happy off the ground
When the friends you thought you had haven't stuck around.
That's when you feel my kind of love.
You won't see me at the parties,
I guess I'm just no fun.
I won't be turning up the radio
Singing "Baby You're The One".
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you, it beats only for you.
I know sometimes I get angry
And I say what I don't mean.
I know I keep my heart protected,
Far away from my sleeve.
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you, it beats only for you.
Cause when you've given up
When no matter what you do it's never good enough.
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough,
That's when you feel my kind of love.
And when you're crying out.
When you fall and then can't pick your happy off the ground
When the friends you thought you had haven't stuck around.
That's when you feel my kind of love.
Cause when you've given up.
When no matter what you do it's never good enough.
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough,
That's when you feel my kind of love.
