Maybe it's the way she walked (ow!)
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards (ow!)
Just like she already owned it
(Zayn-)
I said 'Can you give it back to me?'
She said 'Never in your wildest dreams!'
(All-)
And we danced all night to the best song ever,
We knew every line, now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went oh, oh, oh,
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah,
I think it goes, oh!

Said her name was Georgia Rose,
And her daddy was a dentist
Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)
But she kissed me like she meant it.
(Niall-)
I said 'Can I take you home with me?'
She said 'Never in your wildest dreams!'
(All-)
And we danced all night to the best song ever,
We knew every line, now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her'
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
I think it went oh, oh, oh,
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah,
I think it goes, oh!

And I know, you know, I know you'll remember me

And I know, you know, I hope you'll remember how we danced

How we danced all night to the best song ever
We knew every line, now I can't remember
How it goes but I know that I won't forget her

And we danced all night to the best song ever,
