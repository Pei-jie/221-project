i wouldnt kill to win a war
i dont get what they do it for
its all so terribly vague
i see the pictures from a thousand years of battle
and i think its such a bore
i walk new orleans with a knife
like mackie hidden out of sight
but id be useless if they jumped
im really not the killing type
im not the killing type
im not the killing type
im not im not
im not the killing type im not
ive got a picture of your mum
before the war when she was young
shes got an etching to her right
i think its funny that shes looking to the left and its her son
i wouldnt kill to get you back
and ive officially been asked
i couldnt kill to save a life
id rather die a peaceful piece of shit-bait shame-filled coward
thanks
im not the killing type
im not the killing type
im not im not
im not the killing type im not
but i would kill to make you feel
i dont mean kill someone for real
i couldnt do that, it is wrong

i just cant explain how good it feels
i just cant explain how good it feels

i once stepped on a dying bird
it was a mercy killing
i couldnt sleep for a week
i kept feeling its breaking bones
i heard
that if you see a star at night
and the conditions are just right
and you are standing on a cliff
then you can close your eyes
and make a wish
and take a step
and change somebodys life
im not the killing type
im not the killing type
im not im not
im not the killing type im not
but i would kill to make you feel
id kill to move your face an inch
i see you staring into space
i wanna stick my fist into your mouth and twist your arctic heart

i dont mean kill someone for real
i couldnt do that, it is wrong
but i can say it in a song a song a song
and im saying it
