My my, cold hearted child, tell me how you feel
Just a blade in the grass, spoke unto the wheel
My my, cold hearted child, tell me where it's all gone
All the luster of your bones, those arms that held you strong
I've been worryin' that my time is a little unclear
I've been worryin' that I'm losing the ones I hold dear
I've been worryin' that we all, live our lives, in the confines of fear
My my, cold hearted child, tell me how you feel
Just a rain in the morning air, dark shadow on the hill
My my, cold hearted child, tell me where it all falls
All this apathy you feel will make a fool of us all
I've been worryin' that my time is a little unclear
I've been worryin' that I'm losing the ones I hold dear
I've been worryin' that we all, live our lives, in the confines of fear
Oh I will become what I deserve
Oh I will become what I deserve
Oh I will become what I deserve
Oh I will become what I deserve
I've been worryin', I've been worryin',
I will become what I deserve
I've been worryin',
My time is a little unclear
I will become what I deserve
I've been worryin', I've been worryin'
That my time is a little unclear
I've been worryin', I've been worryin'
That I'm losing the ones I hold dear
I've been worryin', I've been worryin'
That we all, live our lives, in the confines of fear
