Oh baby don't you want to go
Oh baby don't you want to go
Back to the land of california
to my sweet home chicago
Oh baby don't you want to go
Oh baby don't you want to go
Back to the land of california
to my sweet home chicago
Now one and one is two
two and two is four
I'm heavy loaded baby
I'm booked I gotta go
Cryin baby

back to the land of california
to my sweet home chicago
Now two and two is four

You gonna keep monkeyin round here friend-boy

back to the land of california
to my sweet home chicago
