Let's go for a drive
See the town tonight
There's nothing to do but I'll unwind when I'm with you
This town's so strange
They built it to change
And while we sleep we know the streets get rearranged
With my old friends, it was so different then
Before your war against the suburbs began
Before it began
And now the music divides
Us into tribes
You grew your hair so I grew mine
They said the past won't rest
Until we jump the fence and leave it behind
And my old friends, I can remember when
You cut your hair
We never saw you again
Now the cities we live in
Could be distant stars
And I search for you
In every passing car
The nights so long
Yeah, the nights so long
I've been living in the shadows of your song
Living in the shadows of your
Song
In the suburbs I, I learned to drive
People told me we would never survive
So grab your mother's keys we leave tonight
You started a war
That you can't win
They keep erasing all the streets we grew up in
Now the music divides
Us into tribes
You choose your side I'll choose my side
All my old friends, they don't know me now
Oh-oh
All my old friends, are staring through me now
Oh-oh
All my old friends, they don't know me now
All my old friends, they don't know me now
All my old friends, wait
