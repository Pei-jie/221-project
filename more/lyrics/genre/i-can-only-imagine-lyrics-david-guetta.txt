Where you been
Where you been all my life
Baby it's a sin
The way you look in that light
It's obvious
That I want something from you
And you know what
What I wanna do, do, do
(Chorus)
Every touch, it would bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
Oh, everytime, it would bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
What it'd be like, what it'd be like,like,like
What it'd be like,like,like,like,like...
Saw you from afar
Thought I'd say "what's up"
You can tell me your name, when we're breaking up
They call me, Tunechi, I'm good, I'm gucci
Now you can kiss your old dude goodbye, smooches
You're a beast, you're a beauty
Man I think somebody done gave cupid a Uzi, shoot me
You're a firework, brighter in the dark
So let's turn off the lights
And give me that spark
(Chorus)
Every touch, it would bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
Oh, everytime, it would bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
What it'd be like, what it'd be like,like,like
What it'd be like,like,like,like,like...
I want your love
Or touch please
Want you to feel free (It Would Bring Me to Liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiife)
She could kiss me
So I can finally be (girl)
So I can finally see (kiss me now)
So I can finally see (kiss me now)
Saw you from afar
Thought I'd say "what's up"
You can tell me your name, when we're breaking up
They call me, Tunechi, I'm good, I'm gucci
Now you can kiss your old dude goodbye, smooches
You're a beast, you're a beauty
Man I think somebody done gave cupid a Uzi, shoot me
You're a firework, brighter in the dark
So let's turn off the lights
And give me that spark
What it'd be like
