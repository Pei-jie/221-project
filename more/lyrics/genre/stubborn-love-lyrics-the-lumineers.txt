VERSE 1
She'll lie and steal and cheat, and beg you from her knees.
Make you thinks she means it this time
She'll tear a hole in you, the one you can't repair
But I still love her, I don't really care
BRIDGE
When we were young, Oh Oh, we did enough
When it got cold, Ooh Ooh, we bundled up
I can't be told, Ah Ah It can't be done
VERSE 2
It's better to feel pain, than nothing at all
The opposite of love's indifference
So pay attention now, I'm standing on your porch screaming out
And I won't leave until you come downstairs
CHORUS
So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, keep your love
VERSE
And I don't blame ya dear for running like you did, all these years.
I would do the same, you best believe
And the highway signs say were closed, but I don't read those things anymore
I never trusted my own eyes
BRIDGE
When we were young oh oh, we did enough
When it got cold, Ooh ooh we bundled up.
I can't be told, Ah ah, it can't be done.
CHORUS
So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love x2
Keep your head up, keep your love
Head up, love x4
