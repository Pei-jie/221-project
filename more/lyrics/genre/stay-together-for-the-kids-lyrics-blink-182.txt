Its hard to wake up
When the shades have been pulled shut
This house is haunted
Its so pathetic
It makes no sense at all
I'm ripe with things to say
The words rot and fall away
What stupid poem
Could fix this home
I'd read it every day
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost
It's not right
Their anger hurts my ears
Been runnin' strong for seven years
Rather then fix the problems
They never solve them
It makes no sense at all
I see them everyday
We get along so why can't they?
If this is what he wants
And it's what she wants
Then why's there so much pain?
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost
It's not right
So here's your holiday
Hope you enjoy it this time, you gave it all away
It was mine, so when you're dead and gone
Will you remember this night, twenty years now lost
It's not right
It's not right
It's not right
It's not right
