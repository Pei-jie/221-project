Coldplay
rock
You cut me down a tree and brought it back to me
And that's what made me see where I was going wrong
You put me on a shelf and kept me for yourself
I can only blame myself, you can only blame me
And I could write a song a hundred miles long
Well that's where I belong and you belong with me
And I could write it down or spread it all around
Get lost and then get found or swallowed in the sea
You put me on a line and hung me out to dry
Darling that's when I decided to go to see you
You cut me down to size and opened up my eyes
Made me realize what I could not see
And I could write a book, the one they'll say that shook the world
And then it took, it took it back from me
And I could write it down and spread it all around
Get lost and then get found and you'll come back to me
Not swallowed in the sea, ooh ah
And I could write a song a hundred miles long
Well that's where I belong and you belong with me
The streets you're walking on, a thousand houses long
Well that's where I belong and you belong with me
Oh what good is it to live with nothing left to give
Forget but not forgive, not loving all you see
Oh the streets you're walking on a thousand houses long
Well that's where I belong and you belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea
You belong with me, not swallowed in the sea
Yeah, you belong with me
Not swallowed in the sea
