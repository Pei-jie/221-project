Spirit bird
Give it time and wonder why do what we can laugh an we cry and we sleep in your dust because we've seen this all before.
Culture fades with tears and grace leaving us stunned hollow with shame we have seen this all, seen this all before.
Many tribes of a modern kind, doing brand new work, same spirit by side, joining hearts and hand and ancestral twine, ancestral twine.

Slowly it fades. Slowly we fade
Spirit bird she creaks and groans she knows she has, seen this all before she has, seen this all before.
Spirit bird she creaks and groans she knows she has, seen this all before she has, seen this all before.
Slowly it fades. Slowly you fade
Soldier on soldier on my good country man. Keep fighting for your culture, now keep fighting for your land.
I know its been thousands of years and i feel your hurt and i know its wrong and you feel youve been chained and broken and burned and those beautiful old people those wise old souls have been ground down for far too long by that spineless man that greedy man that hearless man deceiving man government hand taking blood and land taking blood and land and still they can but your dreaming and your warrior spirit lives on and it is so so so strong in the earth in the trees in the rocks in the water in your blood and in the air we breath
Soldier on soldier on my good country man, keep fighting for your children now keep fighting for your land
Slowly it fades slowly we fade slowly you fade slowly it fades
Give it time and we wonder why do what we can laugh and we cry and we sleep in your dust because weve seen it all before
