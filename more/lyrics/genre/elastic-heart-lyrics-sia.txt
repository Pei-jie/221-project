And another one bites the dust
But why can I not conquer love?
And I might've got to be with one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it, I wanted it bad
But there was so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
And let's be clear, I trust no one
You cannot break me
I'm still fighting for peace
Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade, it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band, until you pull too hard
And I may snap and I move close
But you won't see me pull apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
I've got an elastic heart
Yea, I've got an elastic heart
And now I step through the night
Let's be clear, won't close my eyes
And I know that I can't survive
I walked too far to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one
You cannot break me
I'm still fighting for peace
Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade, it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band, until you pull too hard
But I may snap and I move close
But you won't see me pull apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
Well I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade, it might be too sharp
I'm like rubber band, until you pull too hard
But I may snap and I move close
But you won't see me pull apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
Well I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade, it might be too sharp
I'm like rubber band, until you pull too hard
But I may snap and I move close
You won't see me pull apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
I've got an elastic heart...
