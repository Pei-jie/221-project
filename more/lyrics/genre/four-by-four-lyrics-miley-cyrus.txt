These Four Walls they whisper to me they know secret I knew they would not keep
Didn't take long for the room to fill with dust
And these four walls came down around us
[Chorus:]
Must of been something set me out of my head
With the words so radical
And not what I meant
Now wait for a break in the silence
Cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again
It's hard now to let you be
I won't make excuses
I've made my peace
Didn't take long for me to lose the trust
Cause these four walls were not strong enough
[Chorus:]
Must of been something set me out of my head
With the words so radical
And not what I meant
Now wait for a break in the silence
Cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again
Yeah it's difficult
Watching us fade
Knowing it's all my fault
My mistake
Yeah it's difficult
Letting you down
Knowing it's all my fault
That you're not around
[Chorus:]
Must of been something set me out of my head
With the words so radical
And not what I meant
Now wait for a break in the silence
Cause it's all that you left
Just me and these four walls again
Again
These Four walls again
