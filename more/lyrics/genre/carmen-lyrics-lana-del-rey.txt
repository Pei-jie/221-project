Darling, darling, doesn't have a problem
Lying to herself cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarming, honestly how charming she can be
Fooling everyone, tell 'em how she's having fun
She says, "you don't want to be like me,
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen,
I'm dying, I'm dying"
She says, "you don't want to get this way,
Famous, and dumb at an early age,
Lying, I'm lying"
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like god, her mind's like a diamond
Audio tune lies, she's still shining.
Like lightning, like lightning.
Carmen, Carmen, staying up 'til morning
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarming, truly how disarming you can be
Eating soft ice cream, Coney island queen
She says you don't want to be like me
Working for fun, gettin' high for free
I'm dying, I'm dying
She says you don't want to get this way
Street walk at night, and a star by day
It's tiring, tiring
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like god, her mind's like a diamond
Audio tune lies, she's still shining
Like lightning, like lightning.
Baby's all dressed up with nowhere to go
That's the little story of the girl you know
Relying on the kindness of strangers
Tying cherry knots, smiling, doing party favors
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
Sing your song, song, now, the camera's on
And you're alive again
Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi
Tu as besoin de moi, tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie
Tu ne peux vivre sans moi
Et je mourrai sans toi, je tuerais pour toi
The boys, the girls, they all like carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like god, her mind's like a diamond
Audio tune lies, she's still shining
Like lightning, like lightning.
Like lightning, like lightning.
Darling, darling, doesn't have a problem
Lying to herself cause her liquour's top shelf
