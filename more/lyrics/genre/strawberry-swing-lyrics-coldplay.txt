Coldplay
rock
They were sitting, they were sitting in the strawberry swing
And every moment was so precious
They were sitting, they were talking in the strawberry swing
And everybody was for fighting, wouldn't wanna waste a thing
Cold, cold water bring me 'round
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Cold, cold water what you say?
It's such, it's such a perfect day, it's such a perfect day
I remember we were walking up to strawberry swing
I can't wait 'til the morning, wouldn't wanna change a thing
People moving all the time inside a perfectly straight line
Don't you wanna curve away?
It's such it's such a perfect day, it's such a perfect day
Ah, now the sky could be blue, I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time
Could be blue, I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time
The sky could be blue, could be gray
Without you I just slide away
The sky could be blue, I don't mind
Without you it's a waste of time
