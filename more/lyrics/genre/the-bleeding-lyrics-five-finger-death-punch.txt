I remember when all the games began
Remember every little lie and every last goodbye
The promises you broke, words you choked on
And I never walked away, its still a mystery to me
Well, I'm so empty, I'm better off without you
And you're better off without me
Well, you're so unclean, I'm better off without you
And you're better off without me
The lying, the bleeding, the screaming
Was tearing me apart
The hatred, deceiving, the bleeding
It's over
Paint the mirrors black to forget you
I still picture your face and the way you used to taste
Roses in a glass, dead and wilted
To you this all was nothing, everything to you is nothing
Well, you're so filthy, I'm better off without you
And you're better off without me
Well, I'm so ugly, you're better off without me
I'm better off without
The lying, the bleeding, the screaming
Was tearing me apart
The hatred, the beatings, disaster
Its over
As wicked as you are
You're beautiful to me
You're the darkest burning star
Youre my perfect disease
The lying, the bleeding, the screaming
Was tearing me apart
The hatred, the beatings, its over
Disaster
The lying, the bleeding, the screaming
Was tearing me apart
The hatred, the beatings, its over
Disaster
It's over now
