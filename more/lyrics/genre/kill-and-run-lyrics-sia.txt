Sia
indie
Watching the sequence of sounds
coming out of your mouth
but the song is too loud
follow the hands as they move
try to make out your mood
but my brain doesn't want to
I close the door
silent call for you
what have I done to you
kill and run, kill and run
I'm one of the dirty guns
kill and run, kill and run
a bullet through your heart
interpret the eyes as they die
should i cry should i love
your poor lashes blow
victim of sensory love
you cry all alone
an innocent call
I close the door
silent call for you
what have I done to you
kill and run, kill and run
I'm one of the dirty guns
kill and run, kill and run
a bullet through your heart
kill and run, kill and run
I'm one of the dirty guns
kill and run, kill and run
A bullet through your heart
