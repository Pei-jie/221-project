Yuna
indie
There's a place I used to know
A seed I used to sow
Sometimes I want to go back
And give them all I have
Try to show some love
There is a place I need to find
And need to be there in time
Don't try to overanalyze
I'm just a girl fighting her tide
I'm so much stronger
They will need to listen to what I have to say
There's a bigger sea for a girl like me
When I come back try to show some love
When I come back try to show some love
Try to show some love
There's a place I used to know
A seed I used to sow
Sometimes I want to go back
And give them all I have
I'm so much stronger
They will need to listen to what I have to say
There's a bigger sea for a girl like me
When I come back try to show some love
When I come back try to show some love
Try to show some love
Oh they will need to listen, listen
I'm so much stronger they will need to listen to what I have to say
There's a bigger war that I'm fighting for
when I come back try to show some love
When I come back try to show some love
Try to show some love
