We, we don't have to worry about nothing
Cause we got the fire
And we're burning one hell of a something
They, they gonna see us from outer space, outer space
Light it up
Like we're the stars of the human race, human race
When the lights turned down
They don't know what they heard
Strike a match, play it loud
Giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands
Shining up to the sky
Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire fire fire
And we gonna let it burn burn burn burn
We gonna let it
Burn burn burn
Gonna let it burn burn burn burn

And what we see
Is everybody's on the floor acting crazy getting lurker to
Turn the lights out
Musics on, I'm waking up
We stop the vibe
And we bump it up
And it's over now
