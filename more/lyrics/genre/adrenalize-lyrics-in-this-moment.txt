Adrenalize me
Come a little bit closer
Before we begin
Let me tell you how I want it...
And exactly what I need I'm here for one drug
I'm only here for one thing
So come on and tell me...
Can you fly like you're free?
Cause I need to feel yeah I Need to say...
I must confess I'm addicted to this
Shove your kiss straight through my Chest
I can't deny I'd die without this
Make me feel like a god Music, Love, and sex
Adrenalize me
I crave excess turning wine into sweat dripping
Down my neck I can't deny I'd die without lust
Make me feel like a god
Adrenaline and sex...
Get a little bit higher
So we can fall till we bleed
Push a little bit
Harder Pull me in to the speed
So tell me can you feel this
Come into my dream
Are you ready to awaken?
Are you ready to feel?
Cause I need to feel

Chest I can't deny I'd die without this
Make me feel like a god Music,
Love, and sex "Adrenalize me"
I crave excess turning wine into sweat dripping
Down my neck I can't deny I'd die without this
Make me feel like a god
Adrenaline and sex...
We have to live, before we die.
We were born to roam before we die.
Don't you want to live before you die?
Let me see you live before you die.
WE'RE DIFFERENT NOW

Make me feel like a god Music, Love, and sex
Adrenalize me
I crave excess turning wine into sweat dripping down my neck
I can't deny I'd die without this
Make me feel like a god adrenaline and sex..
