Its our party we can do what we want
Its our party we can say what we want
Its our party we can love who we want
We can kiss who we want
We can see who we want (2x)
Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we dont care
Cause we came to have so much fun now
Bet somebody here might get some now
If youre not ready to go home
Can I get a hell no
Cause we gonna go all night
Till we see the sunlight alright
So la da di da di, we like to party
Dancing with Miley
Doing whatever we want
This is our house
This is our rules
And we cant stop
And we wont stop
Cant you see its we who own the night
Cant you see it we who bout that life
And we cant stop
And we wont stop
We run things, Things dont run we
We don't take nothing from nobody
Its our party we can do what we want
Its our party we can say what we want
Its our party we can love who we want
We can kiss who we want
We can see who we want
To my home girls here with the big butt
Shaking it like we at a strip club
Remember only God can judge ya
Forget the haters cause somebody loves ya
And everyone in line in the bathroom
Trying to get a line in the bathroom
We all so turned up here
Getting turned up, yeah, yeah

Dancing with Miley
Doing whatever we want
This is our house
This is our rules
And we cant stop
And we wont stop
Cant you see its we who own the night
Cant you see it we who bout that life
And we cant stop
And we wont stop
We run things
Things dont run we
We don't take nothing from nobody
Its our party we can do what we want
Its our party we can say what we want
Its our party we can love who we want
We can kiss who we want
We can see who we want
