Cristine:
In sleep he sang to me, in dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
And do I dream again? For now I find
The Phantom of the opera is there inside my mind.
phantom:
Sing once again with me, our strange duet
My power over you grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me to glance behind
The Phantom of the opera is there inside your mind.
Cristine and phantom:
Those who have seen your face draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear,(C) it's me they hear(p)
Your spirit and my voice in one combined(C&P)
The Phantom of the opera is there inside your mind(p).
music:
He's there, the phantom of the opera
Beware, the phantom of the opera
phantom:
Where all your fantasies, you always knew
That man and mystery lay both in you
And in this labyrinth where night is blind
The Phantom of the opera is here inside your mind.
phantom:
Sing, my angel of music
He's there the Phantom of the opera.
