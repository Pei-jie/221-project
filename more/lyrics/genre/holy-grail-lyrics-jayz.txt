[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
You take the clothes off my back
And I let you
You steal the food right out of my mouth
And I watch you eat it
I still don't know why
Why I love it so much
Ohhh
You curse my name
In spite to put me to shame
Have my laundry in the streets
Dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why
Why our love is so much
Yeah
[Hook]
And Baby
It's amazing I'm in this Maze with you
I just cant crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you here, one day you there, one day you care
You're so unfair
Sipping from the cups
Till it runneth over, Holy Grail
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Blue told me remind you niggas
Fuck that shit y'all talk about
I'm the nigga, uh caught up in all these lights and cameras, uh
But look what that shit did to Hammer, uh
God damnit it I like it
The bright lights is enticing
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
30 mill for one fight
But soon as all the money blows, all the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheating on me
What I do, I took her back, fool me twice
That's my bad, I cant even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder, Momma please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself
[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
And we all just entertainers
And were stupid, and contagious
And we all just entertainers
[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
And Baby
Its amazing Im in this maze with you
I just cant crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you here, one day you there, one day you care
You're so unfair sipping from the cup
Till it runneth over, Holy Grail
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper
Photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See them by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough
I'm calling this off
Who the fuck I'm kidding though?
Im getting high
Sitting low
Sliding by
In that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurts
But this chain works
I think back
You asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga deal with
It, this shit aint work
This light work
Camera snapping, my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and IRS
Get the hell up off of your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for
Dry yours
Why you mad
Take the good with the bad
Dont throw that baby out with the bath water
Youre still alive
Still that nigga
Niggas you survived
You still getting bigger nigga
Living the life
Vanilla wafers
In a villa
Illest nigga alive
Michael Jackson thriller
[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
And Baby
Its amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just cant crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day youre so cold
One day you here, one day you there, one day you care
You're so unfair sipping from the cups
Till it runneth over, Holy Grail
[Verse 4: Justin Timberlake]
You get the air right out my lungs
Whenever you need it,
And you'd take the blade right out my heart
Just so you can watch me bleed
And I still don't know why...
(Don't know why)
Why I love it so much...
Yeah...
And you play this game
In spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve forever in ink
With guess who's name
But I still don't know why
(Don't know why)
Why our love is so much
Yeah...
[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
And Baby
It's amazing Im in this maze with you
I just cant crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day youre so cold
One day you here, one day you there, one day you care
Youre so unfair
Sipping from the cup
Till it runneth over, Holy Grail
