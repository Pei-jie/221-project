Birdy
indie
I don't know where I am
I don't know this place
Don't recognize anybody
Just the same old empty face
See, these people they lie
And I don't know
What to value anymore
There comes you
To keep me safe from harm
There comes you
To take me in your arms
Is it just a game?
I don't know
Is it just a game?
I don't know
He denies to break my heart
So homesick and confused
But I know I must play my part
And tears I must conceal
But there comes you
To keep me safe from harm
There comes you
To take me in your arms
Is it just a game?
I don't know
To keep you safe from my bow
Take my hand and my heart races
Flames illuminate our faces
And we are on fire
Blow a kiss to the crowd
They're our only hope now
And now I know my place
And now I know my place
We're all just pieces
In their games
