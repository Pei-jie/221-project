That slow burn wait while it gets dark, bruising the sun.
I feel grown up with you in your car, I know it's dumb.
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
We both got a million bad habits to kick - not sleeping is one.
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip, I'm biting my tongue.
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
People are talking, people are talking (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
People will talk, yeah, people will talk
Raise a glass cause I'm not done saying it.
They all wanna get rough, get away with it.
Let 'em talk cause we're dancing in this world alone, world alone, we're alone.
All my fake friends and all of their noise, complain about work
They're studying business, I study the floor, and you haven't stopped smoking all night.
Maybe the Internet raised us, or maybe people are jerks.
People are talking, people are talking (But not you)
People are talking, people are taking
Raise a glass cause I'm not done saying it.
They all wanna get rough, get away with it.
Let 'em talk cause we're dancing in this world alone, world alone, we're alone.
All the double edged people and schemes
They make a mess, then go home and get clean
You're my best friend, so we're dancing in a world alone, world alone, we're all alone.
I know we're not everlasting
We're a train wreck waiting to happen
One day the blood won't flow so gladly
One day we'll all get still(people are talking, people are talking)
Get still? (People are talking, people are talking)
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
People are talking, people are talking (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
People are talking, people are talking
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Raise a glass, cause I'm not done saying it.
They all wanna get rough, get away with it.
Let 'em talk cause we're dancing in this world alone, world alone, we're alone.
All the double edged people and schemes
They make a mess, then go home and get clean
You're my best friend, and we're dancing in a world alone, world alone, we're all alone.
People are talking, people are talking
People are talking, people are talking
People are talking, people are talking
People are talking, people are talking
Let 'em talk
