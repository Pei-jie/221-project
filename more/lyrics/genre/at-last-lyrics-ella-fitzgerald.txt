Ella%20Fitzgerald
blues
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
At last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you
I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I could call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known well
You smile and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song
At last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you
You smile and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last
At last, you are mine at last
