Those who are dead are not dead
They're just living in my head
And since I fell for that spell
I am living there as well, oh
Time is so short and Im sure
There must be something more
Those who are dead are not dead
They're just living my head, oh
And since I fell for that spell
I am living there as well, oh
Time is so short and Im sure
There must be something more
You thought you might be a ghost
You thought you might be a ghost
You didnt get to heaven but you made it close
You didnt get to heaven but you made it close
You thought you might be a ghost
You thought you might be a ghost
You didnt get to heaven but you made it close
You didnt get to heaven but you, oh, oh, oh, oh
Those who are dead are not dead
Theyre just living my head, oh
