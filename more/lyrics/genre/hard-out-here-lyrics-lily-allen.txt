I suppose I should tell you
What this bitch is thinking
You'll find me in the studio
And not in the kitchen
I won't be bragging 'bout my cars
Or talking 'bout my chains
Don't need to shake my arse for you
'Cause I've got a brain
If I told you 'bout my sex life
You'd call me a slut
Them boys be talking 'bout their bitches
No one's making a fuss
There's a glass ceiling to brake, uh huh
There's money to make
And now it's time to speed it up
'Cause I can't move with this pace
Sometimes it's hard to find the words to say
I'll go ahead and say them anyway
Forget your balls and grow a pair of tits
It's hard, it's hard, it's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard for a bitch, for a bitch, for a bitch
It's hard, it's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard for a bitch, for a bitch, for a bitch
It's hard, it's hard out here
If you're not a size six
And you're not good looking
Well, you better be rich
Or be real good at cooking
You should probably lose some weight
'Cause we can't see your bones
You should probably fix your face
Or you'll end up on your own
Don't you want to have somebody
Who objectifies you
Have you thought about your butt
Who's gonna tear it in two
We've never had it so good, uh huh
We're out of the woods
And if you can't detect the sarcasm
You've misunderstood
Sometimes it's hard to find the words to say
I'll go ahead and say them anyway
Forget your balls and grow a pair of tits
It's hard, it's hard, it's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard for a bitch, for a bitch, for a bitch
It's hard, it's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard for a bitch, for a bitch, for a bitch
It's hard, it's hard out here
A bitch, a bitch, a bitch, bitch bitch bitchâ€¦
Inequality promises that it's here to stay
Always trust the injustice 'cause it's not going away
Inequality promises that it's here to stay
Always trust the injustice 'cause it's not going away
Sometimes it's hard to find the words to say
I'll go ahead and say them anyway
Forget your balls and grow a pair of tits
It's hard, it's hard, it's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard for a bitch, for a bitch, for a bitch
It's hard, it's hard out here for a bitch
It's hard for a bitch, for a bitch, for a bitch
It's hard, it's hard out here
