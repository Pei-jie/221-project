Now you're gone
I realized my love for you were strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall
Now you're gone
I realized my love for you were strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall
Is this the way it's meant to be?
Only dreaming that you're missing me
I'm waiting here at home
I'll be crazy now you're gone
There's an empty place in my heart
Without my Anna it will break apart
It won't heal, it never fades away
I'll be thinking 'bout you everyday
Are you ready? Now you're gone
I realized my love for you were strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall
Is this the way it's meant to be?
Only dreaming that you're missing me
I'm waiting here at home
I'll be crazy now you're gone
Now you're gone
I realized my love for you were strong
And I miss you here now you're gone
I keep waiting here by the phone
With your pictures hanging on the wall
Is this the way it's meant to be?
Only dreaming that you're missing me
And I'm waiting here at home
I'll be crazy now you're gone
There's an empty place in my heart
It won't alarm me, it will break apart
It won't heal, it never fades away
I'll be thinking 'bout you everyday
