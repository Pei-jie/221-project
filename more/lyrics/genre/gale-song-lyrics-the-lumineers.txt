It's a lonely road
Full of tired men
And you can see it in their faces
And you'll be home in spring
I can wait till then
I heard you're on a big train
And all this too shall pass
This loneliness won't last for long
I wasn't there to take his place
I was ten thousand miles away
So when you hear my voice
When you say my name
May it never give you pain
I don't wanna go
But it's time to leave
You'll be on my mind, my destiny
And I won't fight it in vain
I love you just the same
I couldn't know what's in your mind
But I saw the pictures, you're looking fine
And there was a time
When I stood in line for love, for love, for love
But I let you go, oh, I let you go
And he fell apart
With this broken heart
And this blood, this blood, this blood
Oh, it drains from my skin and dust
