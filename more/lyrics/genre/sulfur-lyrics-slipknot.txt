metal
My guilt and my shame
Always sell me short, always feel the same
And my face and my soul
Always wear me thin, always under control
But the longest hours youll have in your life
Are the ones you sit through to know if youre right
So Ill wait but I pray that I'm wrong
Because I think I know whats going on
So let me get this straight
The only will is my own
I do whatever I want and stay alone
All my decisions make it untouchable and tainted
I'm gonna suffer for the rest of my life
But I will always find a way to survive
I'm not a failure but I know what its like
I can take it or leave it or die
Stay, you dont always know where you stand
Till you know that you wont run away
Theres something inside me that feels
Like breathing in sulfur
My life is undone
And I'm a sinner to most but a sage to some
And my Gods are untrue
I'm probably wrong but I'm better than you
And the longest hours Ive had in my life
Were the ones I went through to know I was right
So I'm safe but I'm a little outside
I'm gonna laugh when I'm buried alive
Stay, you dont always know where you stand
Till you know that you wont run away
Theres something inside me that feels
Like breathing in sulfur, like breathing in sulfur
Like breathing in sulfur
Like breathing in sulfur
Stay, you dont always know where you stand
Till you know that you wont run away
Theres something inside me that feels
Like breathing in sulfur, like breathing in sulfur
Stay, you dont always know where you stand
(You dont always know where you stand)
Till you know that you wont run away
Theres something inside me that feels
(Theres something inside me that feels)
Like breathing in sulfur, like breathing in sulfur
Like breathing in sulfur
Like breathing in sulfur
Like breathing in sulfur
Like breathing in sulfur
