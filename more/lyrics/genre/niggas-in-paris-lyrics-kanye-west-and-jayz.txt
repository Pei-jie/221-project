[Jay-Z Deep Slow Voice]
Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me
[Jay-Z]
So I ball so hard muhfuckas wanna find me
But first niggas gotta find me
What's 50 grand to a muhfuka like me
Can you please remind me?
Ball so hard
This shit crazy
Ya'll don't know that don't shit phase me
The Nets could go 0-82 and I look at you like this shit gravy Ball so hard,
This sh*t weird
We ain't even spose to be here,
Ball so hard, Since we here
It's only right that we be fair
Psycho, I'm liable to be go Michael
Take your pick, Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
Ball so hard
Got a broke clock, Rolleys that don't tick tok
Audemars that losing time, Hidden behind all these big rocks
B-ball so hard
I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
If you escaped what I've escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
Ball so hard
Let's get faded, Le Meurice for like 6 days
Gold bottles, scold models, Spillin' Ace on my sick J's
Ball so hard
Bitch behave, Just might let you meet Ye,
Chi towns D. Rose, I'm movin' the Nets to BK
[Hook]
Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me
That shit cray (x6)
[Kanye West]
She said Ye can we get married at the mall?
I said look you need to crawl 'fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
B-ball so hard
That shit cray, Ain't it Jay?
B-ball so hard
What she order, fish filet
B-ball so hard
Your whip so cold, this old thing
Ball so hard
Act like you'll ever be around muhfuckas
Like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand
Fuck that bitch she don't wanna dance
Excuse my French but I'm in France (I'm just sayin)
Prince William's ain't do it right if you ask me
Cause if I was him I would have married Kate & Ashley
What's Gucci my nigga?
What's Louie my killa?
What's drugs my deala?
What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest
Cause I'm suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris
And they going gorillas, huh!
[Will Ferrel & Jon Heder]
"I don't even know what that means"
"No one knows what it means but its provocative"
"No it's not..."
"It gets the people GOING"

Actin' like the summer ain't mine
[Jay-Z]

[Kanye West]
You know how many hot b**ches I own
Don't let me get in my zone (x4)
The stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling

How you know, I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me into my zone (x2)
[Jay-Z & Kanye West]
I'm definitely in my zone
