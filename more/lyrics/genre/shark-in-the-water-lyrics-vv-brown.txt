Sometimes I get my head in a dilly
Feeling so lost, ticking you off
Now boy you know me well, said I'm that kind of feeling
That kind of soft, that kind of silly
But when I'm in doubt
I open my mouth
And words come out
Words come out like
Baby there's a shark in the water
There's something underneath my bed
Oh, please believe, I said
Baby there's a shark in the water
I caught them barking at the moon
Better be soon
High in the sky, the song that I'm singing
A sweet little lie, I cry wolf cry
Rabbit out the hat, yes that's what I'm bringing
Tricks up my sleeve for noticing me
Oh yeah, wouldn't cause you any harm
I just want you in my arms
I can't help
I can't help myself
Baby there's a shark in the water
There's something underneath my bed
Oh, please believe, I said
Baby there's a shark in the water
I caught them barking at the moon
Better be soon, better be soon
Right is right, rules are rules
This is what I get for just winding you up
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Please don't make too much of it
It ain't that serious
Yes
Baby there's a shark in the water
There's something underneath my bed
Oh, please believe, I said
Baby there's a shark in the water
I caught them barking at the moon
You better get here soon
Baby there's a shark in the water
Baby there's a shark in the water
Baby there's a shark in the water
I caught them barking at the moon
Better be soon
