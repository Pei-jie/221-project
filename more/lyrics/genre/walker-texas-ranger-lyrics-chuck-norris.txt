punk
In the eyes of a ranger,
The unsuspected stranger
Had better know the truth of wrong from right,
'cause the eyes of a ranger are upon you,
Any wrong you do he's gonna see,
When you're in Texas look behind you,
'cause that's where the rangers are gonna be
*Tirk Wilder is the songwriter who wrote this song. The title is actually "Eyes of the Ranger"
