Well the ink in my pen ran dry
Long before your smile
And the pages have always been blank
Like the trees in the wild
But the wind, yes, the wind
Keeps pushing you and me
Time in time
I know when it's time to leave
And the memories we make
Will never been lost, no
And the look on your face
We both knew the cost
But the wind, yes, the wind keeps howling
I put in the pictures, you put in the time
You put all those memories so deep inside my mind
Now the wind, yes the wind keeps pushing you and me
And time in time, I know when it's time to leave
And the memories we made
Will never be lost, no
And the look on your face, we both knew the cost
But the wind, yes the wind kees howling
Even if it was a mistake
I can't forget your face
Even if it was just a day
You won't forget the one
Who's making you shake
(Come around, I lost my way to see) x4
Even if it was a mistake (Come around, I lost my way to see)
I can't forget your face (Come around, I lost my way to see)
Even if it was just a day (Come around, I lost my way to see)
You won't forget the man
Who's making you shake
Who's making you shake
You shake
Ah, making you shake
You shake
Ah, making you shake
