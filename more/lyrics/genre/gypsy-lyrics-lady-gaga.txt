Sometimes a story has no end,
Sometimes I think that we could just be friends.
'Cause I'm a wandering man, he said to me.
And what about our future plans?
Does this thing we have even make sense?
When I got the whole world in front of me.
So I said,
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight.
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life.
I don't wanna be alone forever, maybe we could see the world together.
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!
So, I just packed my baggage and
Said goodbye to family and friends.
And took a road to nowhere, on my own.
Like Dorothy on the yellow brick,
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick.
'Cause I left everyone I love at home.
And I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight.
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life.
I don't wanna be alone forever, maybe we could see the world together.
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!
'Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a Gypsy, Gypsy, Gypsy,
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm A Gypsy, Gypsy, Gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm A Gypsy, Gypsy, Gypsy, I'm
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm A Gypsy, Gypsy, Gypsy, I'm
And then he asked me, he said, 'Baby, why do we love each other?'
I said, 'Honey, it's simple - it's the way that you love and treat your mother.'
Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight.
I'm a man without a home, but I think with you I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess,
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset,
Bust the rear view and fire up the jets cause it's you and me
Baby for life! (Would you go with me?)
For life! (See the world with me)
Cause I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a Gypsy, Gypsy, Gypsy,
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm A Gypsy, Gypsy, Gypsy,
I'm
Russia, UK, Paris, I'm Italian, Asian combined,
African, India, I'm a Gypsy, Gypsy, Gypsy, I'm
Latin-American, I don't speak German but I try.
Someday in Jakarta, I'm American, I'm Gypsy, I
Bangkok, Australia, Malaysia, Sweden, Finland, Norway.
Be my home, just for the day.
I'm a Gypsy,Gypsy,Gypsy, hey.
