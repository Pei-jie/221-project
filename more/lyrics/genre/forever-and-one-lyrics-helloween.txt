Helloween
metal
What can I do? Will I be getting through?
Now that I must try to leave it all behind
Did you see, what you have done to me?
So hard to justify, slowly it's passing by
Forever and one, I will miss you
However I kiss you, yet again
Way down in Neverland
So hard, I was tryin'
Tomorrow, I'll still be cryin'
How could you hide your lies, your lies?
Here I am, seein' you once again
My mind so far away
My heart so close to stay
Too proud to fight
I'm walkin' back into night
Will I ever find someone to believe?
Forever and one, I will miss you
However I kiss you, yet again
Way down in Neverland
So hard, I was tryin'
Tomorrow, I'll still be cryin'
How could you hide your lies, your lies?
Forever and one, I will miss you
However I kiss you, yet again
Way down in Neverland
So hard, I was tryin'
Tomorrow, I'll still be cryin'
How could you hide your lies, your lies, your lies?
