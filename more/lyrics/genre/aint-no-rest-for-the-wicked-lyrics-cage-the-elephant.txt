I was walkin' down the street, when out the corner of my eye
I saw a pretty little thing approachin' me
She said I've never seen a man
Who looks so all alone, could you use a little company?
If you pay the right price your evenin' will be nice
Or you can go and send me on my way
I said you're such a sweet young thing, why you do this to yourself?
She looked at me and this is what she said
Oh, there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed
There ain't nothin' in this world for free
I know I can't slow down, I can't hold back
Though you know I wish I could
Oh no, there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good
Not even fifteen minutes later after walkin' down the street
When I saw the shadow of a man creep out of sight
And then he swept up from behind, he put a gun up to my head
He made it clear he wasn't lookin' for a fight
He said give me all you've got, I want your money not your life
If you try to make a move I won't think twice
I told him you can have my cash but first you know I gotta ask
What made you wanna live this kind of life?
He said there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed
There ain't nothin' in this world for free
I know I can't slow down, I can't hold back
Though you know I wish I could
Oh no, there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good
Well, now a couple hours passed and I was sittin' at my house
The day was windin' down and comin' to an end
And so I turned on the TV and flipped it over to the news
And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend
I saw a preacher man in cuffs, he'd taken money from the church
He stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills
But even still I can't say much because I know we're all the same
Oh yes, we've all seek out to satisfy those thrills
You know there ain't no rest for the wicked
Money don't grow on trees
We got bills to pay, we got mouths to feed
There ain't nothin' in this world for free
I know we can't slow down, we can't hold back
Though you know we wish we could
No there ain't no rest for the wicked
Until we close our eyes for good
