My pussy tastes like Pepsi Cola
My eyes are wide like cherry pies
I gots a taste for men who're older
It's always been so it's no surprise
Ah he's in the sky with diamonds
And it's making me crazy
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby
Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
Come on come on come on come on come on baby
Woah ah yeah
I fall asleep in an American flag
I wear my diamonds on Skid Row
I pledge allegiance to my dad
For teaching me everything he knows
Ah he's in the sky with diamonds
And it's making me crazy
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby, yeah
Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
Drug, suck it up, like Vanilla Ice is
Don't treat me rough, treat me really nice-is
Decorate my neck, me, I'm on diamond ices
Why, come on come on come on
Oooh...
Yeow!
Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
Come on come on come on baby
Come on come on come on baby
Woah ah
My pussy tastes like Pepsi Cola
Oooh... ah
My pussy tastes like Pepsi Cola
Oooh....
My pussy tastes like Pepsi Cola
Oooh... woah...yeah
