I got chills, they're multiplying, and I'm losing control
'Cause the power you're supplying, it's electrifying
You better shape up, 'cause I need a man, and my heart is set on you
understand, to my heart I must be true
CHORUS:
You're the one that I want, ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want, ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want, ooh ooh ooh
Can't you see, oh yes indeed, oh yes indeed
VERSE:
Em
If you're filled with affection, you're
Meditate my direction, feel your way
You better shape up, cause I need a man, who can keep me satisfied
You better shape up, you better prove, that my faith is justified
But I'm sure down deep inside
CHORUS:
You're the one that I want, ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want, ooh ooh ooh, honey
The one that I want, ooh ooh ooh
Can't you see, oh yes indeed, oh yes indeed
OUTRO:
Em
