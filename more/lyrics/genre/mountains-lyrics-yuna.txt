Yuna
indie
I wish I meant something to you
Like you did to me
I wish I could stay as new
As when you first found me
Oh my
Head is tight from just tryna hide my views
Oh when
I keep trying my best just to keep you
Place me in the corner
Inside your heart
So that you remember
Baby when I'm gone…
(chorus)
Are you still having fun
While I'm still waiting
(Waiting for the mountains to fall)(x2)
Maybe when I am gone
You'll learn something
(Waiting for the mountains to fall)(x2)
I'm not as smart as your books
But I know how to look
Out for you…
I come with the head and the heart
Being using it from the start
And my
Brain is starting to suffering bcos of you
Still
I've been trying my best just to please you
Place me in the corner
Inside your heart
So that you remember
Baby when I'm gone…
(chorus)
Are you still having fun
While I'm still waiting
(Waiting for the mountains to fall)(x2)
Maybe when I am gone
You'll learn something
(Waiting for the mountains to fall)(x2)
Place me in the corner
Inside your heart
So that you remember
Baby when I'm gone…
(chorus)
Are you still having fun
While I'm still waiting
(Waiting for the mountains to fall)(x2)
Maybe when I am gone
You'll learn something
(Waiting for the mountains to fall)(x2)
