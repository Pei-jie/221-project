pop
I walked through a puddle of water and I seen the shadow of a broken hearted girl
Pictured us walking through the alter, for better or for worse
[Future and Miley:]
Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh my darling stand by me
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be a 3D, a 3D
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be a 3D, 3D
Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh my darling stand by me
[Miley:]
I ain't pop no Molly, but you still got me sweatin'
What happened to that feeling, we'll never get it back
I ain't take no shots but you still got me hot
What happened to that feeling, I wish it wouldn't stop
[Future and Miley:]
We were supposed to be together
We were supposed to be together
[Miley Cyrus:]
They say that love can hit you so fast
And the odds are running out of time
But ours is on the border walk baby
Take me as I am or not
I can't breathe without you, without you as mine
[Future and Miley:]
Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh my darling stand by me
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be a 3D, a 3D
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be a 3D, 3D
Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh my darling stand by me
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be a 3D, a 3D
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be a 3D, 3D
Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh my darling stand by me
