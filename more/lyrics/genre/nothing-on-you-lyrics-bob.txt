Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing, but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
'Cause they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
I know you feel where I'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of really was for the hell of the fun
On the carousel, so around I spun
With no directions just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun
This is how I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly I ended up with none
There's no much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinking baby, I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wondering
If there was something that you wanna know
But never mind that, we should let it go
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode
And all the bad thoughts, just let them go
Go, go
Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing, but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
'Cause they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
Hands down, there will never be another one
I been around, and I never seen another one
Look at your style, they ain't really got nothing on
And you out, and you ain't got nothing on
Baby, you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes
And you keep it real while them other stay plastic
You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr. Fantastic
Stop, now think about it
I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even went out there to Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia to New Orleans
But you always steal the show
And just like that girl you got me froze
Like a Nintendo 64
If you never knew, well, now you know
Know, know
Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing, but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
'Cause they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
Everywhere I go, I'm always hearing your name
And no matter where I'm at, girl, you make me wanna sing
Whether a bus or a plane or a car or a train
No other girls on my brain, and you the one to blame
Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasing, but my time would be wasted
They got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
'Cause they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
Yeah, and that's just how we do it
And I'ma let this ride
