Two birds on a wire
One tries to fly away and the other
Watches him close from that wire
He says he wants to as well but he is a liar
I'll believe it all
There's nothing I won't understand
I'll believe it all
I won't let go of your hand
Two birds on a wire
One says c'mon and the other says I'm tired
The sky is overcast and I'm sorry
One more or one less, nobody's worried
I'll believe it all
There's nothing I won't understand
I'll believe it all
I won't let go of your hand
Two birds of a feather
Say that they're always gonna stay together
But one's never going to let go of that wire
He says that he will but he's just a liar
Two birds on a wire
One tries to fly away and the other
Watches him close from that wire
He says he wants to as well but he is a liar
Two birds on a wire
Once tries to fly away and the other
