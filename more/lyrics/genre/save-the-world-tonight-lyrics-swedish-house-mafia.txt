Into the streets, we're coming down
We never sleep, Never get tired
Through urban fields, and suburban life
Turn the crowd up now, We'll never back down
Shoot down a skyline, watch it in primetime
Turn up the love now, listen up now, turn up the love
Who's gonna save the world tonight?
Who's gonna bring you back to life?
We're gonna make it, you and I
We're gonna Save The World tonight
Ohoh oh oh, oh oh ohoh oh [x9]
So far from home, it's for the better
What we dream, it's all that matters
We're on our way, united
Turn the crowd up now, We'll never back down
Shoot down a skyline, watch it in primetime
Turn up the love now, listen up now, turn up the love
Who's gonna save the world tonight?
Who's gonna bring you back to life?
We're gonna make it, you and I
We're gonna Save The World tonight
Ohoh oh oh, oh oh ohoh oh [repeated til end]
