I look into the mirror
And see a different girl
Hiding from herself with
Not a care in the world
Her smile pretends to fool
Those she chooses to please
If they could only see the tears she cries for help
See, I have been that girl
Didnt know which way to turn
Then one day I turned to me
I told myself to wake up
Its gonna be a better day
I've just got to believe that
My dreams wont have to wait
At times Ive lost my mind
Had to look deep inside
And find a way to get over
Had to swallow my pride
I searched the world for the answers
But Ive been searching too far
Because Ive been here all along
Im here to make a statement
My place Im here to claim it
Dont tell me what my name is
I Know
Im gonna make it
Ive come to far to lose it
Gotta stay focused
And find a better me
Feels like forever
Trying to work it out
Sometimes youre gonna fail
And you know
Sometime it will rain
But the sun will come
When u think its all said and done
You know u see the light
And everything is alright
You can do
Whatever you set your mind to
Cause youre all that you need
Like I do just believe
Youre here to make a statement
Youre place youre here to claim it
You know just what your name is
Now Go
Youre gonna make it
Youve come to far to lose it
Gotta stay focused
And find a better you
I gotta love me
I gotta know me
I gotta find me
I now will know
Ive been here all along
Im here to make a statement
My place Im here to claim it
Dont tell me what my name is
I Know
Im gonna make it
Ive come to far to lose this
Gotta stay focused
And find a better me
Just believe
Youre here to make a statement
Youre place youre here to claim it
You know just what your name is
Now Go
Youre gonna make it
Youve come to far to lose it
You gotta stay focused
And find a better you
Im here to make a statement
My place Im here to claim it
Dont tell me what my name is
I Know
Im gonna make it
Ive come to far to lose it
Gotta stay focused
And find a better me
