If you ever change your mind
About leavin'
Leavin' me behind
Well, baby, bring it on home
Bring it on home to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know, I laughed when you left
But now I know
I only hurt myself
But I'll be forgiven if you
Bring it on home
Bring it on home to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll give you jewelry and money too
That ain't all
That ain't all I'd do for you
If you would only
Bring it on home to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know I'll always be your slave
'Til I'm buried
Buried in my grave
But I'm forgiven if you
Bring it on home to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
