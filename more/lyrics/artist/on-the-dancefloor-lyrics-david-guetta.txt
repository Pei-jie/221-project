David%20Guetta
electronic
Feel that heat risin' hard
Hear that beat, turn it up
They be movin', that's what's up
They be, they be on the cup
On the cup, do that dance
Got me lookin' in a trance
Just like fire, Russian dance
Someone call the ambulance
I like it, you like it
We like futuristic
Just ride it, don't fight it
Get down to the music
Don't stop it, can't rock it
It's coming like a bullet
It's burnin' like fire
So go ahead and lose it
Turn it up, break it down
Shake it up, mix it now
David technique for the dance floor
Will I is a work precision
I be cuttin' right concision
Guetta ghetto for the dance floor
The G, the U, the T, the T
The A, the AA, we all play
We be, we be ro-ro-ro-rockin' this
Sh-sh-sh- right every day
Feel the sound powerful
Mega broads on overload
Electric city pumpin' on the dance floor
