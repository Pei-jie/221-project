Yeahh Ohhh
Gunfire left a hole in the tank, losing gasoline
Fire is on my trail and he's after me
Hope it don't get here before I get where I'm going I gotta get where I'm going
Take off my mask to breathe
You could've been a part of a masterpiece
Fluid in the brakes was the last to leak
That's the thing
Where im going I don't need my brakes,
Can't wait to see your face,
When your front windows break,
and I come crashing through
The lovers need to clear the road
Oh oh
Because this thing is ready to blow
Oh oh
I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb...
Fire bomb
Seems cold but baby no it doesn't have to be,
Microwaving a metal tragedy
Watching it burning, it's beautiful and it's blue
and it's pitiful and it's blue, it's the other half of me
I didn't do it you lit the match for me,
Now we're flying from the blast baby,
Thats the thing.
Where we're going we don't need no brakes,
Can't wait to see your face,
when your front windows break,
and I come crashing through.
The lovers need to clear the road
Oh oh,
Because this thing is ready to blow
Oh oh,
I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb...
Fire bomb
Baby we were killin' em,
They couldnt handle the millionth degree
We were criminals,
As we were burning, the world called the police
Fire department, ambulance
You can call me crazy 'cause I believe
The only move for me and you
Is to go out blazing
The lovers need to clear the road
Oh, oh, oh
Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh, oh
I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Oh oh
Fire bomb
