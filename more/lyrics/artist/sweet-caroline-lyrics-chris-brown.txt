Oh mother, sweet caroline
Feels like you shot me with a 38 over 45
My hearts bleeding baby
Can't feel my legs I'm paralysed
I know you just in it for the moment
So ill enjoy the ride
[pre-hook]
Eyes start rolling in back of my head
Girl I'm already gone
I can see all of nothing whats happening
Can't even look at your face
Girl I'm fading away
Girl your drug is automatic
[hook]
Higher than a fan
One sip of that lights out
I'm just floating above the clouds
It really feels like life
Sweet love of mine
Your my sweet caroline
My sweet caroline
[Verse 2]
Ooh baby I'm down
As long as you do the same
Ill try the same shit
Right now Right now
Baby tell me when you start to feel it
[?]
Yeah baby
Just like falling in motion
All the emotions
Its not at all
Fall with me
[pre-hook]

[verse 3:Busta Rhymes]
Breezy...
