Greetings loved ones,
Let's take a journey!
[Katy Perry]
I know a place,
Where the grass is really greener!
Warm, wet and wild,
There must be something in the water!
Sippin' gin 'n' juice,
Laying underneath the palm trees!
The boys, break their necks,(and done)
try'na creep a little sneak peek,
at us!
You could travel the world,
But nothin' comes close,
To the golden coast!
Once you party with u-us,
you'll be fallin' in love!
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhh!
California girls, we're unforgettable,
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top!
Sunkissed skin,
So hot we'll melt your popsicle!
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhh!
California girls, we're undeniable,
Fine, fresh, fierce,
We got it on lock!
West coast represent, now put your hands up!
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhh!
Sex, on the beach,
We don't mind sand in our stilettos!
We fre-e-eak in my Jeep,
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo!
You could travel the world,
But nothin' comes close,
To the golden co-oast
Once you party with u-us,
you'll be fallin' in love!
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhh!
California girls, we're unforgettable,
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top!
Sunkissed skin,
So hot we'll melt your popsicle!
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhh!
California girls, we're undeniable,
Fine, fresh, fierce,
We got it on lock!
West coast represent, now put your hands up!
Oh oh oh ohhhhhhh!
[Snoop Dogg]
Toned, tanned fit and ready,
turn it up 'cos it's gettin' heavy,
wild, wild, west coast,
these are the girls I love the most!
I mean the ones,
I mean like she's the one,
Kiss her,
Touch her,
Squeeze her buns...
The girl's a freak,
She drives a Jeep,
And lives on the beach.
I'm okay
I won't play
I love the Bay
Just like I love L.A.
Venice Beach
And Palm Springs
Summertime is everything!
Homeboys
Hangin' out
All that ass
Hangin' out
Bikinis, tankinis, martinis
No weenies
Just a king and a queen-ie
Katy my lady
You're lookin'here baby
I'm all up on ya'
'Cos you representin' California!

Oh oh oh ohhhhhhh!
California! California Girls.
California! California Girls.
