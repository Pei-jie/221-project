Every now and then we all want something
Even if there's no way of gettin' it
If I stomp my feet could that make me
Be the way around it, could I get myself around it?
Get me what I want
Everything that I got
So get me what I want
Cause I'm a big shot
Don't wanna always have to be so nice
Don't wanna hear you say well that's just life
I dry you out when I open my mouth
I make my way around it, I always make my way around it
Get me what I want
Everything I don't got
Get me what I want
Cause I'm a big shot
So give me what I want
I always get what I want
You don't want to see me when
I don't get what I want
That's not what you want
I'm not about to take no for an answer
No, if I tell you I cant I'm still gonna go
I did it all by myself and I found
I found my way around it
Get me what I want
Everything I don't got
Get me what I want
Cause I'm a big shot
So give me what I want
I always get what I want
You don't want to see me when
I don't get what I want
That's not what you want
It's not to lovely
It could start to get ugly
It really bugs me
If I don't get my way
Get me what I want
Everything I don't got
Get me what I want
Cause I'm a big shot
So give me what I want
I always get what I want
You don't want to see me when
I don't get what I want
It's not what you want
I don't get what I want
It's not what you want
