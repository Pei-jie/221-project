Warning like a substitute, I've been working awful hard for you
But you don't say, you just hold your breath
So I can't touch what I haven't yet
She's a cold one and it hurts me so
It's a dark path and a heck of a go
If she could feel me like she did before
Oh, we'd be so free
Happy alone
Sharing a smile
So far from home
Push in and then pull it away, it's the hard part but the true love way
Till you want it like a wanted man
With your smart mouth and your killer hand
We can both share all that I have made
For a young man it's a heck of a wage
And I feel crazy when I see your face
'Cause we'd be so free
Happy alone
Sharing a smile
So far from home
And we would laugh
Laugh till we cry
Making a song
You making me lie
And people say our babies are walking this town
And people say our babies are walking this town
And people say our babies are just wondering around
And people say our babies are walking a
We'd be so free
Happy alone
Sharing a smile
So far from home
And we would laugh
Laugh till we cry
Making up songs
You making me lie, happy alone
