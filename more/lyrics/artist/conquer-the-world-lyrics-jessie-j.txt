[Verse 1]
I know how it feels to cry in the middle of the night
With nobody else by my side no no
If you need to escape the dark
Let me be your light
So know that you don't have to be alone
In this fight no
[Pre 1]
Oh, I know 'coz i've been there
Oh, so we ain't going no where no
[Chorus 1]
Don't ever give up
On us on us on us
Say you'll fight for love
Promise promise promise
I'm gonna be strong for you
When the days get rough
So don't ever give up
Together we can conquer the world
Oh oh oh oh oh
Together we can conquer the world
[Verse 2]
I know how it feels to scream
'Coz nobody believes
Their telling you forget your dreams
Yeah yeah
Don't let it sink in too deep
I don't ever wanna see
You giving up ever 'coz you got me
[Pre 2]
Oh, I know 'coz i've been there
Oh, so we ain't going no where no
[Chorus 2]
Don't ever give up
On us on us on us
Say you'll fight for love
Promise promise promise
I'm gonna be strong for you
When the days get rough
So don't ever give up
Together we can conquer the world
Oh oh oh oh oh
Together we can conquer the world
[Bridge 1]
When no one else
Is there to help
I will be there
Oh, I know 'coz i've been there
Oh, so we ain't no where
[Chorus 3]
Don't ever give up
On us on us on us
Say you'll fight for love
Promise promise promise
I'm gonna be strong for you
When the days get rough
So don't ever give up
Together we can conquer the world
Oh oh oh oh oh
Together we can conquer the world
Together, Together, Together
