Give me love like her,
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone.
Paint spotted tear drops on my shirt,
Told you I'd let them go.
And I'll fight my corner,
Maybe tonight I'll call ya,
After my blood turns into alcohol,
No I just wanna hold ya,
Give a little time to me, we'll burn this out,
We'll play hide and seek, to turn this around,
All I want is the taste that your lips allow,
my my, my my oh give me love,
my my, my my oh give me love,
my my, my my oh give me love,
my my, my my oh give me love,
my my, my my give me love.
Give me love like never before,
'Cause lately I've been craving more.
And it's been a while but i still feel the same,
Maybe I should let you go
You know I'll fight my corner,
And that tonight I'll call ya,
After my blood, is drowning in alcohol,
No I just wanna hold ya,
Give a little time to me, we'll burn this out,
We'll play hide and seek, to turn this around,
All I want is the taste that your lips allow,
my my, my my, oh give me love
Give a little time to me, we'll burn this out
We'll play hide and seek, to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
my my, my my, oh give me love
my my, my my oh give me love,
my my, my my oh give me love,
my my, my my oh give me love,
my my, my my give me love.
my my, my my, oh, give me love,lover....(x12)
(Long Break)
(Hidden Track: The Parting Glass)
Of all the money that e'er I had
I've spent it in good company
And all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lord
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all
A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed back again
But since it has so ordered been
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Goodnight and joy be with you all
Goodnight and joy be with you all
