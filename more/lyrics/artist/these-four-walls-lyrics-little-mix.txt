I feel so numb staring at the shower wall
It's begun, the feeling that the end has come
And now the water's cold
I tried to eat today
but the lump in my throat got in the way
In this time I've lost all sense of pride
I've called a hundred times
If I hear your voice, I'll be fine
And I, I can't come alive
I want the room to take me under
cuz i can't help but wonder
what if I had one more night for goodbye?
If you're not here to turn the lights off I can't sleep
these four walls and me
I lay in bed can't seem to leave your side
Your pillows wet from all these tears I've cried
I won't say goodbye
I tried to smile today
then i realized there's no point anyway
in this time I've lost all sense of pride
I've called a thousand times
if I hear your voice I'll be fine
And I, I can't come alive
I want the room to take me under
cuz I can't help but wonder
what if I had one more night for goodbye?
If you're not here to turn the lights off I can't sleep
these four walls and me
oohh ohh ohhh
And I, I can't come alive
I want the room to take me under
cuz I can't help but wonder
what if I had one more night for goodbye?
If you're not here to turn the lights off I can't sleep
these four walls and me
