Paramore
rock
Give me attention, I need it now
Too much distance to measure it out, out loud
Tracing patterns across a personal map
And making pictures where the lines overlap
Where the lines overlap
No one is as lucky as us
We're not at the end but, oh, we already won
Oh, no, no one is as lucky as us
Is as lucky as us
Call me over and tell me how
Well, you got so far and never making a single sound
I'm not used to it but I can learn
It's nothing to it, I've never been happier
Never been happier
No one is as lucky as us
We're not at the end but, oh, we already won
Oh, no, no one is as lucky as us
Is as lucky as us
And now I've got a feeling if I sang this loud enough
You would sing it back to me
I've got a feeling if I sang this loud enough
You would sing it back to me
I've got a feeling, I've got a feeling
If you would sing it back to me
You would sing it back to me
No one is as lucky as us
We're not at the end but, oh, we already won
Oh, no, no one is as lucky as us
Is as lucky as us, is as lucky as us
