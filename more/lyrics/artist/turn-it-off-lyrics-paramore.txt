Paramore
rock
I scraped my knees when I was praying
And found a demon in my safest haven, seems like
It's getting harder to believe in anything
Than just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts
I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride
To see nothing in the light
Turn it off in all my spite
In all my spite, I'll turn it off
And the worst part is
Before it gets any better we're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom
The tragedy it seems an ending
I'm watching everyone I looked up to break and bending
We're taking shortcuts in for solutions
Just to come out the hero
Well, I can see behind the curtain
The world's cranking, turning so wrong
The way we're working
Towards a goal, that's not existent
It's not existent but we just keep believing
And the worst part is
Before it gets any better we're heading for a cliff
And in the free fall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom
I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride
To see nothing in the light
Just turn it off in all my spite
In all my spite, I'll turn it off
Just turn it off again, again, again, yeah
And the worst part is
Before it gets any better we're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom
And the worst part is
Before it gets any better we're heading for a cliff
And in the free fall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom
