rock
Single book of matches
Gonna burn what's standing in the way
Run down the mountain
Now they're calling on the fire brigade
Bury all the pictures
And tell the kids that I'm okay
If'n I'm forgotten
You'll remember me 'fore today
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I
All the black inside me
Is slowly seeping from the bone
Everything I cherish
Is slowly dying, or it's gone
Little shaken babies
And drunkards seem to all agree
Once the show gets started
It's bound to be a sight to see
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I, I don't wanna be here holding on
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I
Watch her run
Can you feel it?
Watch her run
Can you feel it?
Watch her run
Can you feel it?
Watch her run
Can you feel it?
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I, I don't wanna be here holding on
(Watch her run)
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
(Can you feel it?)
I
(Watch her run)
