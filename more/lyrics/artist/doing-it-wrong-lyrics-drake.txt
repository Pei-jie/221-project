[Verse 1]
When a good thing goes bad
Its not the end of the world.
Its just the end of a world
That you have with one girl.
And she's the reason it happened,
But she's overreacting.
And its all because she don't want things to change.
[Hook]
So cry if you need to,
But I can't stay to watch you.
That's the wrong thing to do.
Touch if you need to,
But I can't stay to hold you.
That's the wrong thing to do.
Talk if you need to,
But I can't stay to hear you.
That's the wrong thing to do.
Cause you'll say you love me,
And I'll end up lying,
And say I love you too.
[Chorus]
But I need someone different.
You know it, oh oh you know it.
Oh oh you know it, we both know it.
I need someone different,
You know it, oh oh you know it.
Oh oh you know it, we both know it.
Something's been missing,
you know it, oh oh she knows it.
Oooh I know it, we all know it.
I need someone different.
Ooohh ooohh.
[Verse 2]
We live in a generation of not being in love,
And not being together.
But we sure make it feel like we're together,
Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else.
[Hook]
So cry if you need to,
But I can't stay to watch you.
That's the wrong thing to do.
Touch if you need to,
But I can't stay to hold you.
That's the wrong thing to do. Oooh.
Talk if you need to,
But I can't stay to hear you.
That's the wrong thing to do.
Cause you'll say you love me,
And I'll end up lying,
And say I love you too.
[Chorus]
But I need someone different.
You know it, oh oh you know it.
Oh oh you know it, we both know it.
I need someone different,
You know it, oh oh you know it.
Oh oh you know it, we both know it.
Something's been missing,
You know it, oh oh she knows it.
Oooh I know it, we all know it.
I need someone different.
Ooohh ooohh.
