Once there was a way,
to get back homeward,
Once there was a way,
to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry,
and I will sing a lullaby
Golden slumbers fill your eyes,
smilles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling do not cry,
and I will sing a lullaby
Once there was a way,
to get back homeward,
Once there was a way,
to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry,
and I will sing a lullaby
Boy you're gonna carry that weight,
carry that weight for a long time
Boy you're gonna carry that weight,
carry that weight for a long time
I never give you my pillow,
I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations,
I break down
Boy you're gonna carry that weight,
carry that weight for a long time
Boy you're gonna carry that weight,
carry that weight for a long time
Oh yeah, all right,
are you gonna be in my dreams tonight?
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
And in the end,
the love you take,
is equal to the love you make,
Ah
