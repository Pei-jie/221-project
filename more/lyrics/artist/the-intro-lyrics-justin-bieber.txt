Hey what's up guys this is Justin Bieber
And this is the BEST DJ in the world his name is DJ Tay James
He's kinda cool
You're now tuning in to the We Know The DJ Radio
Black rims
Black body
Bad girls, you should act naughty
Unless you're girl hang out in the lobby
If you're in my section baby girl you hear the party
VIP, you know it boy
Making millions in the show, yes you know it boy
Said this goes out to all the haters
I'm a young Tunchei ?
Oh my goodness (Why you wearing two rollies?)
I got time and I got money, and I got girls and it's not funny (no not funny)
C'mon bunny c'mon bunny (my bunny)
I open the door
Walk in the store
She sees it's me she says "hello"
I say "what's good?" she says "let's go"
So took her home, take it off
Black rims
Black body
Bad girls, you should act naughty
Oh, that's your girl? In my Ducatti?
If you're in my section baby girl you here to party
Left for dinner think that I would've left her
Yeah, you know I'm flyin' on the jet here
Mommy said remember don't forget dear
So I said it, "everybody you the best here"
Black rims
Black body
Bad girls, you should get naughty
Oh, that's your girl? Had her in the lobby
If you're in my section girl you here to party
