All my life, you know I haven't been very love strong
There's been so many fights that I fought I've never won
So I decided that I should just give up on trying to right your wrongs
And word on the street is that she did to you what you did to me
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Bang, bang, bang, boy
You're going down, down, down, boy
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
Bang, she shot you, karma tastes so
Bang, bang, bang, boy
You're going down, down, down, boy
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
Bang, she shot you, karma tastes so sweet
So unfortunately, for girls like me there are more like you
Bending and breaking the rules and we're making exceptions too
But how does it feel to swim in your own tears?
You lied and you lied, and I died, and I died and now you know why
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Bang, bang, bang, boy
You're going down, down, down, boy
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
Bang, she shot you, karma tastes so
Bang, bang, bang, boy
You're going down, down, down, boy
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
Bang, she shot you, karma tastes so sweet
Bang, bang, bang, boy
You're going down, down, down, boy
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
Bang, she shot you, karma tastes so
Bang, bang, bang, boy
You're going down, down, down, boy
To the ground where you left my heart to bleed
Bang, she shot you, karma tastes so
Bang, bang, bang, boy
You're going down
To the ground
Ooh
