Go make your next choice be your best choice
And if you're looking for a boy with a voice
Well baby, I'm single
Are you in the mood for some dude?
Are you in the mood to be subdued?
Or would you rather just mingle?
Let's get set then to go then
Well let us jet set, we'll be like the Jetsons
You can be Jane, my wife
Should I marry Jane tonight?
See I would, if I could
I'd do anything spontaneously
Or we can keep chilling like ice cream filling
We can be cool in the gang
If you'd rather hang
Ain't no thing
I can be lugubrious with you
I got no if's and or's no wits or what's about it
But this place is getting crowded
And my house is two blocks away
Or maybe closer
See I would, oh if I could
I'd do oh anything spontaneously
You know I would
Oh if I could
I'll do oh anything spontaneously
If you could be nimble
You'd have it simple just like me
So go on and try it
Do not deny yourself your freedom
So step on up to the plate get a date with Mraz
See you better act fast because supplies they never last
Now did you know this is limited time offer?
So go make your mind up
Before our time's up
Say you better start winding it up
Because the party's almost over
And if you should know, girl
It's gonna be lower now
See I would do, oh if I could do
I'd do oh anything spontaneously
You know I would, oh and I could prove it
Oh that I'll do anything spontaneously
