I just can't wait.
(Mariah)
I don't want a lot for christmas, there is just one thing I need,
And I don't care about the presents underneath the christmas tree,
I don't need to hang my stocking, there upon the fireplace,
Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on christmas day,
I just want you for my own, more than you could ever know,
Make my wish come true,
All I want for christmas, is you.
(Justin)
Oh, I won't ask for much this christmas, I won't even wish for snow,
I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe,
I won't make a list and send it to the north pole for Saint Nick,
I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click,
'Cause I just want you here tonight, holding on to me so tight,
What more can I do,
'Cause baby all I want for christmas, is you.
(Both)
All the lights are shining so brightly everywhere,
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air,
And everyone is singing, I hear those sleigh bells ringing,
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need,
Won't you please bring my baby to me.
(Mariah)
I don't want a lot for christmas, this is all I'm asking for,
I just want to see my baby, standing right outside my door,
I just want him for my own, more than you could ever know,
Make my wish come true,
Baby all I want for christmas, is you.
It's all I want for christmas is you baby,
It's all I want for christmas is you baby.
