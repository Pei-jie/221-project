What are we supposed to do
After all that we've been through
When everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone
There is nothing left to prove
Now you still deny this simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep moving on
Now that the love is gone
There is nothing left to prove
Now you still deny this simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that the love is gone
Love is gone
Love is gone
Love is gone
Love is gone
(Feels so right time)
Love is gone
(Feels so right time)
(Got to find a reason)
What are we supposed to do
After all that we've been through
When everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone
There is nothing left to prove
Now you still deny this simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that the love is gone
(Love is gone)
What are we supposed to do
After all that we've been through
When everything that felt so right is wrong
Now that the love is gone
There is nothing left to prove
Now you still deny this simple truth
Can't find the reason to keep holding on
Now that the love is gone
Love is gone
Love is gone
Love is gone
(Got to find a reason)
Got to find a reason
Got to find a reason
Got to find a reason
Got to find a reason
Got to find a reason
Got to find a reason to hold on
(Love is gone)
