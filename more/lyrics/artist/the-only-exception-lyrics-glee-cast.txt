When I was younger I saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind
He broke his own heart as I watched as he tried to reassemble it
And my momma swore she would never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised I'd never sing of love
If it does not exist
But darlin', you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone, keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this, keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I'd have sworn to myself that I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
I've got a tight grip on reality
But I can't let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
And I'm on my way to believing
Oh, and I'm on my way to believing
