[Pitbull]
Went from Mr. 305 ,Dade County, to Mr. Worldwide, all around the world
Now we're International, So international, international, So international
You can't catch me, boy
I'm overseas at about a hundred G's per show
Don't test me boy, (Don't test me boy)
Cause I rap with the best for sure,
305 till the death of me
Cremate my body let the ocean have what's left of me
But for now, forget about that,
Blow the whistle
Baby you're the referee
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You put it down like New York City
I never sleep, wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy, hotter than Miami
I feel the heat!
Ohh,girl, Miss International love
Ohh,yeah, Miss International love
[Pitbull]
I don't play football but I've touched down everywhere
Everywhere? Everywhere!
I don't play baseball but I've hit a home run everywhere, everywhere
I've been to countries and cities I can't pronounce
And the places on the globe I ain't know existed
In Romania she pulled me to the side and told me `Pit, you can have me and my sister.`
In Lebanon, yeah the women are bomb
And in Greece you've guessed it the women are sweet
Been all around the world but I ain't gon' lie there's nothing like Miami's heat
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You put it down like New York City
I never sleep, wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy, hotter than Miami
I feel the heat!
Ohh, girl, Miss International love
Ohh, yeah, Miss International love
[Pitbull]
Down in D.R. they're looking for visas,
I ain't talking credit cards if you know what I mean!
En Cuba, la cosa esta dura!
But the woman get down, if you know what I mean!
In Colombia the women got everything on but they're some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen
In Brazil they're freaky with big old boobs and their thongs, blue yellow and green!
In L.A. tengo la Mexicana, en New York tengo la boricua
Besito para todas las mujeres en Venezuela, muah!
Y en Miami tengo a cualquiera!
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
You put it down like New York City
I never sleep, wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy, hotter than Miami
I feel the heat!
Ohh, yeah, Miss International love
Ohh, yeah, Miss International love
[Chris Brown]
There's not a place that your love don't affect me baby
So don't ever change
I cross the globe when I'm with you baby
Heeey
Woah-oh
[Bridge: Pitbull]
Chris Brown
This for the women worldwide
Let's rap
[Chorus x2: Chris Brown]
You put it down like New York City
I never sleep, wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy, hotter than Miami
I feel the heat!
Ohh, girl, Miss International love
Ohh, yeah, Miss International love
