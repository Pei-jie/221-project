Oh my, ya skipping my heart
kiss in the dark witcha lightning eyes
Sit and watch ya ignitein fires all night
and you got the power you damn right
This life i did
Not gonna like it if we don't connect tonight
Strike twice all night
Body moves like waves
You're reaching my heart fast
You're searching for something
That's just how electricity behaves
Now I needin it so bad
The other ones don't last
Wait a minute I feel a charge
I should of known how she glow in the dark
You turn it on and I touch it til it sparks
Electric lady oooh
Wait a minute, until it drops
I feel it jump we get closer til we shock
You turn it on and I touch it til it sparks
Electric lady
Love won't die, (running low) But girl ya
Love won't die
So what you're giving me girl
I got energy giving, you know how it goes sometimes
Love won't die (running low) But girl ya
Love won't die
But if you needin me girl
I got energy come and get it you know how it goes
Sometimes I need a little
Give a little, If I get a little
We could meet any place
How about the middle tonight
and you got the power
Baby you know if you ever low
I would go low
And then you're back into the light
Strike twice all night
Body moves like waves
You're reaching my heart fast
You're searching for something (yeaaa)
That's just how electricity behaves
Now I needin it so bad
Them other ones don't last
Wait a minute I feel a charge
I should of known how she glow in the dark
You turn it on and I touch it til it sparks
Electric lady oooh
Wait a minute, until it drops
I feel it jump we get closer til we shock
You turn it on and I touch it til it sparks
Electric lady
MUSIC BREAK
Wait a minute I feel a charge
I should of known how she glow in the dark
You turn it on and I touch it til it sparks
Electric lady oooh
Wait a minute, until it drops
I feel it jump we get closer til we shock
You turn it on and I touch it til it sparks
Electric lady
Love won't die, (running low) But girl ya
Love won't die
So what you're giving me girl
I got energy giving, you know how it goes sometimes
Love won't die (running low)
Love won't die
But if you needin me girl
I got energy come and get it you know how it goes
