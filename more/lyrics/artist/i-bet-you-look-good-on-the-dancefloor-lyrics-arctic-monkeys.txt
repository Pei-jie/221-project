Stop making the eyes at me
And I'll stop making the eyes at you
And what it is that surprises me
Is that I don't really want you to
And your shoulders are frozen
(Cold as the night)
Oh but you're an explosion
(You're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio but I don't care for sand
And lighting the fuse might result in a bang b-b-bang! Go!
I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if youre looking for romance or
I don't know what youre looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Well from 1984!
I wish you'd stop ignoring me
Because you're sending me to despair
Without a sound yeah you're calling me
And I don't think it's very fair
That your shoulders are frozen
(Cold as the night)
Oh but you're an explosion
(You're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio but I don't care for sand
And lighting the fuse might result in a bang b-b-bang! Go!
I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
I don't know if youre looking for romance or
I don't know what youre looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Well from 1984!
Oh there aint no love no, Montagues or Capulets
Just banging tunes in DJ sets and
Dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness
I wanna bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if youre looking for romance or
I don't know what youre looking for
I said I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Said from 1984!
