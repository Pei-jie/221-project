rock
You left me hanging from a thread
We once swung from together
I lick my wounds
But I can't ever see them getting better
Some thing's gotta change
Things cannot stay the same
Her hair was pressed against her face
Her eyes were red with anger
Enraged by things unsaid
And empty beds and bad behavior
Some thing's gotta change
It must be rearranged, oh
I'm sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out all right, yeah
The room was silent
As we all tried so hard to remember
The way it feels to be alive
The day that he first met her
Some things gotta change
Things cannot stay the same
You make me think of someone wonderful
But I can't place her
I wake up every morning
Wishing one more time to face her
Some thing's gotta change
It must be rearranged, oh
I'm sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of a heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out all right
So much to love, so much to learn
But I won't be there to teach you, oh
I know I can be close
But I try my best to reach you
I'm so sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of a heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out all right, yeah
