You say keep her close
It's too big to be with
Let me have a breather
It's too dying to be real
Feels too good to be real
Where my weed at? I gotta love it
That's something magic here
Nobody's here but me
It's something, something
One more, baby, take it, take it
One time will I say girl, you are
Something special, yeah, baby
I see something gorgeous
