I'd like to introduce to you
The future, the young new R&B prince, Chris Brown, spit flame
And me, stick around this yo boy, Chris Brown
Ma have you ever seen a four door machine
When them thangs swing open?
(Girl, picture that)
Have you ever traveled upon
A yacht sail across the ocean?
(Girl, picture that)
Tell me, have you ever seen a star
Shoot across a night sky from a G45
Can you picture it?
Matter fact picture you and me living it
I know I'm just a youngin' but girl I'm in a good groove, right zone
I just need a year or two
Let me stack this paper
I'ma keep the lights on, let me show you what a hit single can do
And we can act a fool wit it
So much diamonds you won't know what to do wit it
What's my name? The name Chris Brown from Virginia ask about me They'll tell you I'm the truth wit it
C to H to the R I S
I know you like it mama just say yes
And if you didn't know now you know I'm a pro
I can go on and on and on
C to H to the R I S
I know you like it mama just say yes
And if you didn't know now you know I'm a pro
I can go on and on and on
I know I may sound a little out there
But the south of France I'm tryna take you out there girl
Take my hand and we can walk up out there with brand new bags
Now tell me how does that sound girl
It's crazy how I'm feelin' you
Damn, I gotta get you to see
Girl, yo style is so sensual slide
Your number and just roll with me
I know I'm just a youngin' but girl I'm in a good groove, right zone
I just need a year or two
Let me stack this paper
I'ma keep the lights on, let me show you what a hit single can do
And we can act a fool wit it
So much diamonds you won't know what to do wit it
What's my name? The name Chris Brown from Virginia ask about me They'll tell you I'm the truth wit it
C to H to the R I S
I know you like it mama just say yes
And if you didn't know now you know I'm a pro
I can go on and on and on
C to H to the R I S
I know you like it mama just say yes
And if you didn't know now you know I'm a pro
I can go on and on and on
I see money, money, money everywhere I go
Baby, I'ma cash boy, so where my dough
Girl, I know when you hear my flow
Plus all the honies love me when I wear my fro
A yo, lil mama, I'm known as a Charma
Betta' known as that boy Chevy Impala
Shorty, we can creep while you in yo pajamas
Then we can sip margaritas in the Bahamas
Amiga, Amiga, let's flee to Aruba
We can ride now I got the keys to the crusier
You can be with me ain't gotta be with a loser
Do what it do, let me see you on the move
C to H to the R I S

And if you didn't know now you know I'm a pro

It's Chris Brown, ma, you need to stop playin'
You know what you want
You know what you need and I do too
Come with me, take it back, take it back
Bring it back, bring it back
