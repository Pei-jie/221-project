B.O.B.
hiphop
[Chorus - Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (Wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (Wish right now, wish right now)
(Dreaming, of falling, dreaming, of falling)
[Verse 1 - B.o.B]
Let's pretend like its '98, like I'm eating lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Trying to be the next rapper coming out the A
Hoping for a record deal, to renew my fame
Now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane (Okay)
And everybody know my name (B.o.B)
And everywhere I go people want to hear me sing
Oh yeah, and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did five hundred thousand
Gold in the spring, and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Selling out arenas with big ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination
[Chorus]
[Verse 2 - B.o.B]
Okay, let's pretend like this never happened
Like I never had dreams of being a rapper
Like I didn't write raps up in all of my classes
Like I never used to runaway into the blackness
Now, let's pretend like it was all good
Like I didn't live staring in a notebook
Like I did the things that I probably knew I should
But I ain't have neighbors that's why they call it hood
Now let's pretend like I ain't got a name
Before they ever called me B.o.B or A.K.A Bobby Ray
I'm talking back before the mix tapes
Before the videos, and the deals, and the fame
Before they ever once compared me to Andre
Before I ever got on MySpace
Before they ever noticed my face
So let's just pretend and make wishes out of airplanes
[Chorus]
And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone, they're just memories
And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream
But those days are gone, they're just memories
[Verse 3 - Eminem]
Let's pretend, Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend, things would've been no different
Pretend he procrastinated had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that was so paper thin
They could blow away with the wind
Marshall you never going to make it
Makes no sense to play the game there ain't no way that'll you win
Pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move, and schools weren't changing again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he can rip stadiums
And just lazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium bitch
You won't amount to shit, quit day dreaming kid
You need to get your cranium checked
You thinking like an alien, it just ain't realistic
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even name when he's pissed at
And his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the Rap Olympics
Slept through his plane and he missed it
He's going to have a hard time explaining to Haley and Laney
These food stamps and this WIC shit
Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even, here it he pretends that
[Chorus]
