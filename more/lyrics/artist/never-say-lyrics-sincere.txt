broken in spirit
but wait

and hold you close my dearest

which was true
but truth is i dont
wanna see myself without you
but its too late
should of thought of that
before i made my mistake

but i wish i could erase the pain
and rekindle the flame
but you dont wanna remain
so its words that i have to restrain

one of my bois
it hurts inside but i try to keep strong
but truth is i cant shake this shit
