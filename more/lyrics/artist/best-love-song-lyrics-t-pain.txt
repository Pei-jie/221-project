hiphop
Turn up the bass, turn up the treble
I'm about to take you to a whole 'nother level
DJ, turn off what you're playing
I want the whole club to hear what I'm saying
Because this girl means so much to me
Now we're on the floor and she touching me
And if I wanna take her home
It's gotta be better than what they do on the radio
It's gotta be the crunkest
It's gotta be the loudest
It's gotta be the best
The best love song she ever heard in her life
I gotta tell her how I feel, I gotta let her hear
The best love song she ever heard in her life
No need for me to write it
I just gotta picture her smiling
And if you feel that way, go ahead and kiss your baby
Now we've got the whole stadium in love like that
Turn on the lights, give me a mic
I'm about to sing and do it just as she likes
Jump off the stage
Crowd surfin' all the way, kowabunga
You know it's right, just do the wave
Girl, just move your body like a snake
And if you wanna get with me
Put your hands in the air, show me the energy
It's gotta be the crunkest
It's gotta be the loudest
It's gotta be the best
The best love song she ever heard in her life
I gotta tell her how I feel, I gotta let her hear
The best love song she ever heard in her life
No need for me to write it
I just gotta picture her smiling
And if you feel that way go ahead and kiss your baby
Now we've got the whole stadium in love like that
Homie, kiss your girl, shorty, kiss your man
We can see you on the kissing cam
Please show me some love, show me some love
Now look her in the eye, say baby I love you
I never put no one above you
And if you feel that way go ahead and kiss your baby
And now we've got the whole stadium in love like
And if you feel that way go ahead and kiss your baby
And now we've got the whole stadium in love like
