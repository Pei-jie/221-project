Pink
pop
I'm goin' to California
To live in the summer sun, yea
The streets are made of silver
I'm like a rabbit on the run
Philidelphia freedom
Well it's not like you have heard
No, no, no
This city of brotherly love
Is full of pain and hurt
Yea, ooo
I'm goin' to California
To find my pot of gold
Corruption on every corner
Hustlers sellin' sweets
Baby is home cryin'
While her mom is on the streets
Everybody's dyin'
Have you heard the news today?
A woman in North Phili is mournin'
A bullet took another son away, why?
I'm goin' to California
I'm goin' far, far, far away
Yea, daa
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Yea yea ee yea, yea
Do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do
Goin' to California, yes
To resurrect my soul
The sun is always shinin', shinin'
Or atleast that's what I'm told
I'm goin' to California
(Somebody)
There's a better life for me, yes
Goin' to California
(Goin' to California)
I'll write and tell you what I see
I'm goin' to California, ha aaa
Somebody say a prayer for me
(I'm goin' to California)
Goin' fast as I can
