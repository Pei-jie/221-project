Hell sees her shadow on my backseat
And her friends are standing right in front of me
World wide from the Cimmaron to Turkey
Open up, said everybody loves me
And you don't have to make a sound
'Cause they got what you need, what you need
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Got love for the people that have warned you
God love all your sentimental virtue
Eight balls with the takers that'll make you
Lay cards with the lovers that'll hate you
And you don't have to make a sound
They got what you need, what you need
Make you say
Oh my, feels just like I don't try
Look so good I might die
All I know is everybody loves me
Head down, swaying to my own sound
Flashes in my face now
All I know is everybody loves me
Everybody loves me, everybody loves me
Well I, play the music, don't stop till I turn gray
Stars forever like John Sousa never fade
He had a beautiful child, named her Desiree
Hope I'm remembered for the things that I never made
'Cause you don't have to make a sound
When they got what you need
Make you say
Oh my, feels just like I don't try
Look so good I might die
All I know is everybody loves me
Head down, swaying to my own sound
Flashes in my face now
All I know is everybody loves me
Everybody loves me
Everybody
Everybody, oh
Everybody
Everybody
Don't need my health
Got my name and got my wealth
I stare at the sun
Just for kicks all by myself
I lose track of time
So I might be past my prime
But I'm feeling, oh so good
Yeah
Oh my, feels just like I don't try
Look so good I might die
All I know is everybody loves me
Head down, swaying to my own sound
Flashes in my face now
All I know is everybody loves me
Everybody loves me
Don't you know who you are?
Everybody
Everybody
Everybody
Whoa, yeah
