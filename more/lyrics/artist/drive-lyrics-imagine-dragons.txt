Get me right, all it takes is silent night
I want my eyes to see these lights
Hold hold hold on hold hold on
But when it comes it goes
I am on my knees, oh forgive me
Get me right, look at these people flying kites
They seem to live forgotten nights
Hold hold hold on hold hold on
But when it comes it goes
I am on my knees
Oh forgive me
Drive, I got my head on aright
I got my people strapped tight
I got my head on aright
Oh oh oh oh
I, I got my head on aright
I got my people strapped tight
I got my head on aright
Oh oh oh oh
Oh get me right, all it takes is starry nights
I want my eyes to see these lights
Hold hold hold on hold hold on
But when it comes it goes
I am on my knees
Oh forgive me
Get me right, look at these seagulls in the air
They seem to yell just like we care
Hold hold hold on hold hold on
But when it comes it goes
I am on my knees
Oh forgive me
Drive, I got my head on aright
I got my people strapped tight
I got my head on aright
Oh oh oh oh
I, I got my head on aright
I got my people strapped tight
I got my head on aright
Oh oh oh oh
Drive, I got my head on aright
I got my people strapped tight
I got my head on aright
Oh oh oh oh
I, I got my head on aright
I got my people strapped tight
I got my head on aright
Oh oh oh oh
