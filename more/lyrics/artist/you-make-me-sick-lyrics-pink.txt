Pink
pop
You make me sick
I want you and I'm hatin' it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip
I'm feelin' it, I gotta getta grip
And it's drivin' me crazy
Baby don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me goin' again
Baby, you got me goin' again
You were doin' me sick
He was doin' 8-0 on the freeway
In the 6 double 0, bumpin' Isley
He was gettin' kinda close, kinda touch-ay
'Cuz he had a little too much Hennessey
He told me that he wanna go home
With me up on the hill to my condo
Told me he would keep it all on the low-low
But I told him, "Boo, I don't really know though"
He got closer to me, it started gettin' deep
He had me in a zone
When he started to show me things
I never saw before
Baby, it was smooth but I knew it was game
Hell-of-a-cool but you men are the same
The way he licked his lips and touched my hips
I knew that he was slick
You make me sick
I want you and I'm hatin' it
Got me lit like a candlestick
I get too hot when you touch the tip
I'm feelin' it, I gotta getta grip
And it's drivin' me crazy
Baby don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me goin' again
Baby, you got me goin' again
You make me sick
In the 6 now, so hot
Gotta pull all the windows down eyes lead
And I'm thinkin' bout the sheets now
Wonderin' should I really take it there now
He told me he would make it worth it
Again, how many times have I heard this
Kinda funny, but I wasn't even nervous
Well his slick-ass lines was kinda workin'
I felt my knees get weak
His body was callin' me
Just couldn't take the heat
Anyway it was 2 or 3, I had to get off the streets
Baby was cool but I knew it was game
Said, he was too schooled to be screamin' my name
Even though we made the best of it
I still told him this
"You make me sick
I want you and I'm hatin' it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip"
"I'm feelin' it, I gotta getta grip
And it's drivin' me crazy
Baby don't you quit
Can't get enough of it"
"You got me goin' again
Baby, you got me goin' again
You make me sick"
You make me sick
I want you and I'm hatin' it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip
I'm feelin' it, I gotta getta grip
And it's drivin' me crazy
Baby don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me goin' again
Baby, you got me goin' again
You make me sick
I want you and I'm hatin' it
Got me lit like a candlestick
Get too hot when you touch the tip
I'm feelin' it, I gotta getta grip
And it's drivin' me crazy
Baby don't you quit
Can't get enough of it
You got me goin' again
Baby, you got me goin' again
You make me sick
I want you and I'm hatin' it
Hot when you touch the tip
I'm feelin' it, I gotta getta grip
And it's drivin' me crazy
Baby don't you quit
Can't no no no no no
Oh, you make me sick
I want you and I'm hatin' it
