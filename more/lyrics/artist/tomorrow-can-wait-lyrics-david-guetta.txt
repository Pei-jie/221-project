Live life given now, tomorrow can wait
Dance all through the night, sleeping all day
Stuck inside a box, you gotta get out
Stand up, get up, live your life now, come on
Stand up, get up
Come on, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, come on
Live life given now, tomorrow can wait
Dance all through the night, sleeping all day
Stuck inside a box, you gotta get out
Stand up, get up, live your life now
Come on, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, get up
Stand up, get up
Let's go right now
People lining through this life we lead
Never knowing what we'll find out
So we're living, working and waiting for the day
There'll be something that's coming to take the pain away
We wait for nothing inside your ways
You gotta let that fun girl through
Live life given now, tomorrow can wait
Dance all through the night, sleeping all day
You're stuck inside a box, you gotta get out
Stand up, get up, live your life now
Sometimes it feels
How love indeed
And we're just floating
Searching infinity, infinity, infinity, infinity
Come on and dance here tonight, tomorrow can wait
Dance all through the night, sleeping through the day
Stuck inside a box, you gotta get out
Stand up, get up, live your life now, come on
