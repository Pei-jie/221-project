Just wanna taste the tears
When we're together, that's what my heart really needs
It's nowhere you can get away from this
You need to ', that I gotta say
Only one more fantasy, all I see is you, been dreaming
But you made sweet love to me
And I can have that a million ways, you go
Baby, I'm right where I wanna be
Girl, will we never finish? I'm tryina love for eternity
So baby just sit me where you want me
Please fuck me forever, in the sheets, baby, pillow fight
We can do it all night
I'mma make it right
Girl, I know that you're a freak
Come with me tonight
And I promise, follow me, girl
And I do '
