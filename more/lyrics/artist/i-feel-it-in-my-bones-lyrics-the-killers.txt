Dear Santa
I'm writing you a letter
I'm sure you've got it all figured out
Things haven't been easy between me and you
I guess that there are things that you can't undo
Maybe I was naughty once but now I'm nice
Boy you made the list
You know I checked it twice
Well guess what
You're still on it!
Hahaha!
And I feel it in my bones
And I feel it in my bones
(Ho ho ho...)
Nights have been restless, pillows and sheets
Bet you got it all figured out
I sweat like a snowman out in the sun
Dreaming that there ain't nowhere to run to, baby
Nowhere to hide
Hey, Kringle!
You mean to say when you were young, you never got wild?
Kid, don't you get it?
I'm gonna make an example out of you for every mother's child
And I feel it in my bones
(I'm coming for you)
And I feel it in my bones
Silver bells and reigns
Tinsel, holly
What happened to the rose red cheeks
Chimney, big bag presents and all
Fat and jolly
Tinsel holly
And I feel it in my bones
And I feel it in my bones
And I feel it in my bones
And I feel it in my bones
