Wyclef with Pitbull
The clubs ain't safe tonight
Mamacita, so nice to meet ya
You drunk off that rum, you shouldn't drive tonight
Give me the key to that Beamer
She looked at me and laughed, started shakin' her ass
She said her brother just came home from the jungle
It's a jungle, sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from goin' under with all these woman around me
I got 'em all colors, shapes and sizes
I'm in over my head, these women gon' drown me
Spike Lee was definitely talkin' 'bout me
When he made that movie 'Jungle Fever'
'Cause I like 'em a little bit darker
Take it from the back to the front, Rosa Park, uh
But to tell you the truth, it makes no difference
As long as they know what they doin' when it's time to get busy
We can take it from the floor to the bed
From the bed to the kitchen
Coffee with no cream, that's like a rock with no fiend
Martin Luther King with no dream
John Lennon couldn't even 'Imagine' such a thing
And for those that don't know nothin'
Welcome to the jungle, 'Clef tell 'em somethin'
Mamacita, so nice to meet ya
You drunk off that rum, you shouldn't drive tonight
Give me the key to that Beamer
She looked at me and laughed, started shakin' her ass
She said her brother just came home from the jungle
Como? If you got that hot blood
Esto es pa' la gente con sangre caliente
Turn around, now back up
Preparate mujer porque mi lengua esta fuerte
Morenita que rica esta
She don't speak Spanish, aye mama
That's cool 'cause I'll put the Spanish in ya
And by the end of the night, you'll say aye papa
I'm that chico that got a fetish with women
Light skin, red bones, they blow my mind
I'm that chico that'll get 'em and hit 'em
Now all of a sudden, they wanna be mine
Stop playin' with me, say it with me
Dale papi, dale papi, go
And for those that don't know nothin'
Welcome to the jungle, 'Clef tell 'em somethin'
Mamacita, so nice to meet ya
You drunk off that rum, you shouldn't drive tonight
Give me the key to that Beamer
She looked at me and laughed, started shakin' her ass
She said her brother just came home from the jungle
It's that jungle fever, fever
It's that jungle fever, fever
Watch out, watch out
It's that jungle fever, fever
It's that jungle fever, fever
It's that jungle fever, fever
Watch out, watch out
It's that jungle fever
Now what I'ma do is uh, explain this uh, jungle fever to y'all
This doesn't necessarily mean I like uh, dark women
Doesn't necessarily mean I don't like dark women
What it means is, uh, to get nasty, to get freaky
To do things you've never done before
To act like an animal straight out the jungle
That's jungle fever
Whites, black, Latin, Chinese, lo que sea
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout, right Clef?
Jungle fever, fever, jungle fever, fever
Jungle fever, fever, jungle fever
Jungle fever, fever, jungle fever, fever
Jungle fever, jungle fever, fever
Jungle fever, fever, jungle fever, fever
