Don't know, don't know if I can do this on my own
Why do you have to leave me?
It seems I'm losing something deep inside of me
Hold on, on to me
Now I see, now I see
Everybody hurts some days
It's okay to be afraid
Everybody hurts, everybody screams
Everybody feels this way
And it's okay, it's okay
It feels like nothing really matters anymore
When you're gone, I can't breathe
And I know you never meant to make me feel this way
This can't be happening
Now I see, now I see
Everybody hurts some days
It's okay to be afraid
Everybody hurts, everybody screams
Everybody feels this way
And it's okay, it's okay
So many questions, so much on my mind
So many answers I can't find
Wish I could turn back the time
I wonder why
Everybody hurts some days
Everybody hurts some days
Everybody hurts some days
It's okay to be afraid
Everybody hurts, everybody screams
Everybody feels this way
And it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
Everybody hurts some days
It's okay to be afraid
Everybody hurts some days
Yeah, we all feel pain
Everybody feels this way
And it'll be okay
Can't somebody take me away to a better place
Everybody feels this way, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay
