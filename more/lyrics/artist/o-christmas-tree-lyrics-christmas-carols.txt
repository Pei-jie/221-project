Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree!
Thy leaves are so unchanging
Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree,
Thy leaves are so unchanging
Not only green when summer's here,
But also when winters cold and drear.
Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree,
Thy leaves are so unchanging!
Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree,
Much pleasure do you bring me!
Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree,
Much pleasure do you bring me!
For every year the Christmas tree,
Brings to us all both joy and glee.
Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree,
Much pleasure do you bring me!
Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree,
You'll never be unchanging!
A symbol of good, will, and love
You'll never be unchanging
Each shining light
Each silver bell
No one alive spreads cheer so well
Oh Christmas tree, Oh Christmas tree,
You'll never be unchanging
