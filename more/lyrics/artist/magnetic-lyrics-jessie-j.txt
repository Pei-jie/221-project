Light up, don't know how I did it right from the beginning, my head's kinda spinning
Light up, I won't be forgiven, my life is forbidden, they say it's a miracle
Sometimes I don't even know if I'm wrong or right
I try to drown the sorrow that surfaces every night
I'm moving at a speed that makes everybody look slow
What happens if I let it go
But There ain't no way you're pulling me down
I recharge the speakers and sound
It's okay, it isn't your fault
Everything is alright
Take me to a place I know
Anywhere that feels like home
Somewhere that if I let go
Someone's gonna catch my soul
Magnetic (I've never lived life, but steady as I go)
Here we go! (The sky is the limit as long as it feels good)
Magnetic (I've never lived life, but steady as I go)
Here we go! (The sky is the limit as long as it feels good)
Here we go!
Show me love, sometimes when you give it you don't always get it
That's all that you wanted
Angels, watch like television
Got over my mission, so I gotta finish up
Sometimes I don't even know if I'm wrong or right
I try to drown my sorrow that surfaces every night
I'm moving at a speed that makes everybody looks slow
What happens if I let it go
But there ain't no way you're pulling me down
I recharge the speakers and sound
It's okay, it isn't your fault
Everything is alright
Take me to a place I know
Anywhere that feels like home
Somewhere that if I let go
Someone's gonna catch my soul
Magnetic (I've never lived life, but steady as I go)
Here we go! (The sky is the limit as long as it feels good)
Magnetic (I've never lived life, but steady as I go)
Here we go! (The sky is the limit as long as it feels good)
Here we go!
Vampires and beasts lick tears from my cheeks
I won't hide, behind tweets
And smiles for life
Take me to a place I know
Anywhere that feels like home
Somewhere that if I let go
Someone's gonna catch my soul
Magnetic (I've never lived life, but steady as I go)
Here we go! (The sky is the limit as long as it feels good)
Magnetic (I've never lived life, but steady as I go)
Here we go! (The sky is the limit as long as it feels good)
Here we go!
