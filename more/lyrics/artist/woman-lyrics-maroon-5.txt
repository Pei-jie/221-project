If I'd be so inclined to climb up beside you
Would you tell me that the time just isn't right?
And if I should ever find the key you hide so well
Will you tell me that I can spend the night?
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman
If l could bottle up the chills that you gave me
I would keep them in a jar next to my bed
And if I should ever draw a picture of a woman
It is you that would come flowing from my pen, yeah
Leaving your clothes on my floor
Making me walk out the door and
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman
Fail to understand what it is about this woman
Helplessly melting as I stand next to the sun
As she burns me, I am screaming loud for more
I drink every drop of liquid heat that I've become
Pop me open spill me out onto the floor
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand, fail to understand
Leaving your smell on my coat
Leaving your taste on my shoulder
I still fail to understand what it is about this woman
Yes
