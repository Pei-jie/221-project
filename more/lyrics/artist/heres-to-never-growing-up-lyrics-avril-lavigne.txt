pop
Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boom box blaring as we're falling in love
I got a bottle of whatever, but it's getting us drunk
Singing here's to never growing up
Call up all our friends
Go hard this weekend
For no damn reason,
I don't think we'll ever change
Meet you at the spot,
Half past ten o'clock
We don't ever stop,
And we're never gonna change
Say,wont you stay forever
Stay if you stay forever
Hey we can stay forever young ohhh
Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boom box blaring as we're falling in love
I got a bottle of whatever, but it's getting us drunk
Singing here's to never growing up
We'll be running down the street, yelling kiss my ass
I'm like yeah whatever, we're still living like that,
When the sun's going down, we'll be raising our cups
Singing here's to never growing up
Oh woah oh woah here's to never growing up
Oh woah oh woah here's to never growing up
We live like rock stars
Dance on every bar
This is who we are,
I don't think we'll ever change
They say just grow up but they don't know us
We don't give a fuck and we're never gonna change
Say, oh just say forever, stay
If you stay forever, hey
We can stay forever young
Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boom box blaring as we're falling in love
I got a bottle of whatever, but it's getting us drunk
Singing here's to never growing up
We'll be running down the street, yelling kiss my ass
I'm like yeah whatever, we're still living like that,
When the sun's going down, we'll be raising our cups
Singing here's to never growing up
Oh woah oh woah here's to never growing up
Oh woah oh woah here's to never growing up
Say, won't you stay forever stay
If you stay forever hey
We can stay forever young
Ohhhhhhh
Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs
With the boom box blaring as we're falling in love
I got a bottle of whatever, but it's getting us drunk
Singing here's to never growing up
We'll be running down the street, yelling kiss my ass
I'm like yeah whatever, we're still living like that,
When the sun's going down, we'll be raising our cups
Singing here's to never growing up
Oh woah oh woah here's to never growing up
Oh woah oh woah ( raise your glass and say )
Here's to never growing up
