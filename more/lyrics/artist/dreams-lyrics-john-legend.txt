Every time I close my eyes
Visions of you come to life
And I see
What we could be
I don't want to be awake
I don't want to see a day
Dawnin
Not this morning
Sun brings llight
Reality strikes
So bring back the night
Cause Im longin
To dream dream dream dream
Dream dream dream dream
Like lovers do
And it might come true
If I dream dream dream dream
Dream dream dream dream
It just might be the only time that Im with you
When I dream dream dream
Dream dream dream
Of you
Close to me
Still so far
Close enough
To feel your heart is falling
But he's calling
Baby it seems the time is never right
Youre goin left and Im goin right
Its crazy
But Im still waiting
If I play my cards right
My lucks gonna strike
Until then there's a night
All I wanna do
Is dream dream dream dream
Dream dream dream dream
Like lovers do
And it might come true
If I dream dream dream dream
Dream dream dream dream
It just might be the only time that Im with you
When I dream dream dream
Dream dream
Oh I dream
Yes I dream
Dream dream
Dream dream
They say that dreams they sometimes do come true
Your star shines so bright
Youre the queen of my night
in the daytime not quite
But im so glad that I
Can dream dream dream
Dream dream dream
Like lovers do
And it might come true
If I dream dream dream
Dream dream dream
It just might be
The only time
That Ill be with you
But Ill dream dream dream
Dream dream dream
Of you
