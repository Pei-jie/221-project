Try to tell me what I shouldn't do
You should know by now
I won't listen to you
Walk around with my hands
Up in the air, 'cause I don't care
'Cause I'm alright, I'm fine, just freak out let it go
I'm gonna live my life, I can't ever run and hide
I won't compromise, 'cause I'll never know
I'm gonna close my eyes, I can't watch the time go by
I won't keep it inside, freak out let it go, just freak out let it go
You don't always have to do everything right
Stand up for yourself, and put up a fight
Walk around with your hands up in the air
Like you don't care
'Cause I'm alright, I'm fine, just freak out let it go
I'm gonna live my life, I can't ever run and hide
I won't compromise, 'cause I'll never know
I'm gonna close my eyes, I can't watch the time go by
I won't keep it inside, freak out let it go
Let it go, yea yea yea yea yea
Just let me live my life
I can't ever run and hide
I won't compromise, 'cause I'll never know
I'm gonna close my eyes, I can't watch the time go by
I won't keep it inside, freak out let it go
Gonna freak out let it go, gonna freak out let it go
