Remember love
Remember you and me
Remember everything we shared
On this planet when we cared
Remember hearts
Remember unity
Remember loving neighbors
Without expecting favors
Why be afraid
To make an honest mistake
If you acknowledge the pain
And you wanna change
You can get through anything
Do you remember at all
People walkin' hand in hand
Can we feel that love again
Can you imagine it all
If we all could get along
Then we all could sing this song together
Oh oh oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh-oh
Singin'
Oh oh oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh-oh
Look at me, now look at you
Now look at me again
See we're not so different
Look around
What do you see
We're throwing things outside our window
We don't care to keep it clean
I had a dream
Beauty was only skin deep
And if we all just believe
Love is all we need
Nothing else can set you free
Do you remember at all
People walkin' hand in hand
Can we feel that love again
Can you imagine it all
If we all could get along
Then we all could sing this song together
Oh oh oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh-oh
Singin'
Oh oh oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh-oh
If we could throw away the hate
And make love last another day
Don't give up just for today
Life would be so simple
They may talk about us
But they will never stop us
We'll keep singin'
Oh oh oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh-oh
Come on, we'll keep singin'
Oh oh oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh-oh
Do you remember at all
People walkin' hand in hand
Can we feel that love again
Can you imagine it all
If we could get along
Then we all could sing this song together
Oh oh oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh-oh
Come on, come on, come on, singin'
Oh oh oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh-oh
Hold the hand of your neighbor
Together, together, singin'
Oh oh oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh-oh
Come on and sing it with me
Oh oh oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh oh oh oh-o
