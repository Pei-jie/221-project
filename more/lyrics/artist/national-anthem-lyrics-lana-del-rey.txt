Money is the anthem
Of success
So before we go out
What's your address?
I'm your national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons
Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holdin' me for ransom
Upper echelon
He says to "be cool," but
I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair
Hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on?"
He said, "Yes, yes, yes"
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
(Ooh yeah, baby, bow down
Makin' me so wild now)
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how now
Take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue's in the sky,
Summer's in the air, and baby, Heaven's in your eyes
I'm your National Anthem
Money is the reason
We exist
Everybody knows it
It's a fact
(Kiss, kiss)
I sing the National Anthem
While I am standin'
Over your body
Hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off
Me, or your pants on
See what you've done to me?
Give me a standing ovation
You said to "be cool," but
I'm already coolest
I said to "get real,
Don't you know who you're dealing with?"
Oh, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
(Ooh yeah, baby, bow down
Makin' me so wild now)
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how now
Take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue's in the sky,
Summer's in the air, and baby, Heaven's in your eyes
I'm your National Anthem
It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Winin' and dinin', drinkin' and drivin'
Excessive buyin', overdosin', dyin'
On our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage
Blurrin' the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely
I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well
I can tell, I can tell
Keep my safe in his bell
Tower hotel
Money is the anthem
Of success
So put on mascara,
And your party dress
I'm your National Anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standin' ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of
Sweetness and danger
Queen of Saigon
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
(Ooh yeah, baby, bow down
Makin' me so wild now)
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
(Sugar, sugar, how now
Take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue's in the sky,
Summer's in the air, and baby, Heaven's in your eyes
I'm your National Anthem
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success
