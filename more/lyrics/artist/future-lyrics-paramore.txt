Paramore
rock
Im writin' the future, Im writin' it out loud
We don't talk about the past
We don't talk about the past, now
So Im writin' the future, I'm leavin' a key, here
Something won't always be missing
You won't always feel emptier
Just think of the future and think of your dreams
You'll get away from here, you'll get away eventually
So just think of the future, think of a new life
And don't get lost in the memories
Keep your eyes on a new prize
