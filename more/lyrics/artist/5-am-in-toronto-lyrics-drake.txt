Drake
hiphop
[Intro]
Yeah
This songs from old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit
For my niggas, though
[Verse 1]
You underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
You probably wouldnt lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, cant hear em over the laughter
Yeah, thats cause Im headed to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, Im just being Frank with you
I mean, where you think she at when she aint with you
Wildin, doin shit thats way out of your budget
Owl sweaters and saddle luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin my drive, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook
Thats why every song sound like Drake featuring Drake
Straight white pre?, whys it always me
Got us watchin our words like theres wire taps on the team
Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas
Guess its funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real
Some nobody started feelin himself
A couple somebodies started killin themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin to help
[Verse 2]
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press over the summer for allegations
I aint lyin, my nigga, my time is money
Thats why I aint got time for a nigga whos time is comin
A lot of niggas PR stuntin like thats the movement
And Im the only nigga still know for the music
I swear, fuck them niggas this year
I made Forbes list, nigga
Fuck your list, everythings lookin gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay in the shit, theres a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin money like quarters off multi-platinum recordings
Eat it like Im seated at Swiss?
Nothin was the same, this shit for Easy and Cocoa
This shit for Kareem, this shit for Jaevon
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill
We do this shit for real
All them boys in my will
All them boys is my wheel
Anything happen to pop and I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to poppy, might pop a nigga for real
Comin live from the screwface, livin out a suitcase
But Im feelin good, Johnny got me pushin two plates
My weight up, I refuse to wait up, I started a new race
Its funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like Ive been here for 10
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again
Im on my King James shit, Im tryin to win here again
A young nigga tryin to win here again
Man, whats up
[Outro]
Yeah
A young nigga tryin to win here again
If I like her, I just fly her to the city Im in
I got her drinkin with your boy
I got her fucked up, shorty
Aww yeah
