Verse 1
Find light in the
beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I, You and I
We're like diamonds in the sky
Youre a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

Oh right away
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes
Hook
So shine bright, tonight, You and I
Were beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
Were beautiful like diamonds in the sky
