I'm not a little girl
So promise you won't hide it
Raw as it comes
Oh don't you try to disguise it
Reality is crashing it
And it hits me like broken glass
It's like my entire life
Just got really really fast
Like a melting cloud
I cry out for you yeah
Like an empty room
I'll be missing you
Yeah
We've got so much more to live
We've got so much more to do
Life won't be the same without you oh ohhhoh
We've got so much more to laugh
We've got so much more to lose
Life won't be the same without you ohhh
Oh oh no
No No No
Staring at the dark
I'm the only one awake
Trying to control my tears
But this is stupid hard to take
Clutching on to you
While you're slipping through my hands
I wanna see the good in this
But it just doesn't make any sense ohh
Like a bird that never flew
I'll cry out for you
Like a rose that never grew
I'll be missing you
We've got so much more to live
We've got so much more to do
Life won't be the same without you oh ohhh
We've got so much more to laugh
We've got so much more to lose
No my life won't be the same without you ooh
I wish we'd spent more time together
I should have come to see you more
Wish i'd have learned what you loved
What you hated, what you liked
And the things you adore
And now I'm here trying to fill the space
That once was framed by your face
And when you gone
All I have is this so-oooh-ong
We've got so much more to live
We've got so much more to lose
Life won't be the same without you yeaah
We've got so much more to laugh
We've got so much left to do
No my life won't be the same without you
