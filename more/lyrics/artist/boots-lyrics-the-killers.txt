rock
No more trouble
In this town
Silent night
For a change
Brand new year
Coming up ahead
You know it's been so long
Since I rang one in
I close my eyes
Think about the path I took
Just when I think these times
Have gotten the best of me
I can see my mother in the kitchen
My father on the floor
Watching television
It's a wonderful life
Cinnamon candles burning
Snowball fights outside
Smile below each nose
And above each chin
Stomp my boots before I go back in
I wasted my wishes
On Saturday nights
Boy, what I would give
For just one more
I'd soften my heart
Shock the world
Do you hear my voice?
Do you know my name?
Light my way
Lift my head, light my way
I can see my mother in the kitchen
My father on the floor
Watching television
It's a wonderful life
Cinnamon candles burning
Snowball fights outside
Smile below each nose
And above each chin
Family all together
Presents piled high
Frost on all the windows
What a wonderful night
Cinnamon candles burning
Snowball fights outside
Smile below each nose
And above each chin
So happy they found me
Love was all around me
Stomp my boots before I go back in
