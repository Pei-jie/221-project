Kings%20of%20Leon
rock
He's so the purity, a shaven and a mourning
And standing on a pigeon toe, in his disarray
Straight in the picture pose, he's coming around to meet you
And screaming like a battle cry, it's more if I stay
Me and you're cold, driving in the snow
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Cowgirl king of the rodeo, let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
How dare you come to me like with nail for a favor?
Hold on not my fairy tale you're trying to start
Take off your overcoat, you're staying for the weekend
And swaying like a smokey gray, a drink in the park
Me and you're cold, driving in the snow
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll
Cowgirl king of the rodeo, let the good times roll
Let the good times roll, good time to roll on
Good time to roll on
Good time to roll on
Good time to roll on
