Hey, now I know
Took a chance, rolled the dice on me and you
Opened up, let you in my world
Like a dance started slow and then love took control
Swept away, so proud to be your girl
And when you write a story much to fast
Sometimes a happy ending doesn't last
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know, it's not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
But when it's wrong you gotta let it go, now I know, now I know
Remember when we said our love would last forever
But then again, how are we to know?
There'd come a time that love would change like stormy weather
A sunny day could suddenly turn cold
Time will teach you all you need to learn
But there'll always be a first time you get burned
Oh, how I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know, it's not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know, when it's right, it's so amazing
But when it's wrong you gotta let it go, now I know, now I know
Yeah, I don't regret a single day
The joy and pain along the way
A broken heart's the price we pay
As sad as it may seem
Baby, can't you see it's the way its gotta be?
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know, it's not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
But when it's wrong you gotta let it go, now I know, now I know
Hey, how I know, oh, I know
