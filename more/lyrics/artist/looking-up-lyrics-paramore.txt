Paramore
rock
Things are looking up, oh, finally
I thought I'd never see the day when you smile at me
We always pull through, oh, when we try
I'm always wrong but you're never right
Oh, you're never right
Honestly, can you believe we crossed
The world while it's asleep?
I'd never trade it in 'cause I've always wanted this
And it's not a dream anymore, no, oh, oh, oh
It's not a dream anymore, it's worth fighting for
Could have given up so easily
I was a few cheap shots away from the end of me
Taken for granted, 'most everything
That I would have died for just yesterday, just yesterday
Honestly, can you believe we crossed
The world while it's asleep?
I'd never trade it in 'cause I've always wanted this
And it's not a dream anymore, no, oh, oh, oh
It's not a dream anymore, it's worth fighting for
God knows the world doesn't need another band
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh
But what a waste it would've been
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh
I can't believe we almost have give up
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh
We're just getting started
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh
Honestly, can you believe we crossed
The world while it's asleep?
I'd never trade it in 'cause I've always wanted this
And it's not a dream anymore, no, oh, oh, oh
It's not a dream anymore, no, oh
It's not a dream anymore, no, oh, oh, oh
It's not a dream anymore, it's worth fighting for
I can't believe we almost have give up
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh
We're just getting started
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh
I can't believe we almost have give up
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh
We're just getting started, we're just getting started
