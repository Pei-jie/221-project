[Verse 1]
(Last night)
Our lovers' quarrel
(I was thinkin' about you)
Hurts more than I can say
(And it was... kinda dirty)
All night
(And the way that you looked at me)
Help me, help
(It was kinda nasty, ahh!)
Help me, help!
(It was kinda trashy)
Cause I can't help my mind from going there
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothin' to do
When I lay in bed I touch myself and think of you
[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sexxx dreams (You were in my)
Doin' really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sexxx dreams (You were in my)
Makin' love in my sexxx dreams
[Verse2]
We could be caught
(I just... want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought
(Cause I'm... broken)
Let's white (By the one before) glove the bed
(He was kinda nasty, ahh!)
Help me, help
(And it feels so trashy)
Cause we can't hide the evidence in our hands
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothin' to do
When I lay in bed I touch myself and think of you
[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sexxx dreams (You were in my)
Doin' really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sexxx dreams (You were in my)
Makin' love in my sexxx dreams
[Bridge]
Don't stop the party (Makin' love in my sexxx dreams)
Let's keep it naughty (Makin' love in my sexxx dreams)
Watch me at the pool (Makin' love in my sexxx dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you
Tomorrow when I run into you
You could turn a stone, or the color of
Man petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him
I can't believe I'm telling you this but I've had a couple of drinks and oh my god
[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sexxx dreams (You were in my)
Doin' really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sexxx dreams (You were in my)
(Last night)
Don't stop the party (Damn, you were in my sexxx dreams)
Let's keep it naughty (Doin' really nasty things)
Watch me at the pool (Damn, you were in my sexxx dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you (Makin' love in my sexxx dreams)
