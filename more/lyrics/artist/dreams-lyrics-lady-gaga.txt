Last night
Our lovers quarrel
I was thinking about you
Hurt more than I can say
And it was kind of dirty
Oh my, and the way that you looked at me (help me here)
It was kind of nasty (help me here)
It was kind of trashy
Cause I can't help my mind from going there
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed I touch myself and I think of you
[Chorus]
Last night
Damn you were in my sex dreams
Doing really nasty things
Damn you were in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
We could be caught (I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought (cause I'm broken)
Let's white (by the one before) glove the bed
He was kinda nasty (help me here)
And I feel so trashy
Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed I touch myself and I think of you
[Chorus]
Last night
Damn you were in my sex dreams
Doing really nasty things
Damn you were in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
When we were in the swimming pool
I was gonna show you
And want this something better
Dangerous poetry rhyme with that body some other time to look right on the thousand drug
I can't believe i'm telling you this but I've had a couple of drinks and oh my god
[Chorus]
Last night
Damn you were in my sex dreams
Doing really nasty things
Damn you were in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
