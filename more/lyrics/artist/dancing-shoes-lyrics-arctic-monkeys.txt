rock
Get on your dancin' shoes
There's one thing on your mind
Hopin' theyre lookin' for you
Sure you'll be rummagin' through
Oh and the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride
Yeah but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word
So you're waitin' and waitin'
The only reason that you came
So what you scared for?
Well don't you always do the same?
It's what you there for
Don't you know the lights are flashin'
Down in here tonight?
And some might exchange a glance
But keep pretendin' to dance
Don't act like it's not happenin'
As if its impolite
To go and mention your name
Instead you'll just do the same as they all do
And hope for the best
The only reason that you came
So what you scared for?
Well don't you always do the same?
It's what youre there for, but no!
Get on your dancin' shoes
You sexy little swine
Hopin' theyre lookin' for you
Sure you'll be rummagin through
And I said the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride, yeah
Yeah but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word
So you're waitin and waitin
