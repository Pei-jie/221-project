Hey, mmm, hey
Oh girl, oh girl
We did everything we could do
To try make it work
We did, we did, babe
Baby, you look so confused
'Cause it feels like there was no way we could lose
No way, no way, babe
Baby, I just dont know why I can't find
The things you need in me
I can't, I can't, girl
Baby, they know just what to say
They tryna break us away from one another
But maybe they're right for a change
I think God will give you someone
Much better than me
Trust me, your eyes will be okay
It will be alright
You'll be just fine
Just fine, just fine
I know that, baby
We would disagree constantly
On the basic things
We did, we did, babe
You thought that there was
Someone else all along
No way, no way, babe
Baby, I want to decide to stay right
By your side
I can't, I can't, girl
Baby, they know just what to say
They wanna keep us away from one another
But maybe they're right for a change
I think God will give you someone
Much better than me
Trust me, your eyes will be okay, okay
Alright, alright just fine
Just fine, I know, baby
Baby, baby, can't you see that
Another fella just may be the
Kinda of man that you need?
You deserve it and I know that
I know when other love's come your way
Just listen to me when I say
Youll find him
Be patient loves coming
I think God will give you someone
So much better than me
Trust me, your life will be okay
It'll be alright, it'll be just fine
Oh no, just fine 'cause I know that, women
I think God will give you someone
Someone better than me
Trust me, girl, no more pain
Okay, no more pain, alright
It will be just fine, oh
Hey, hey, hey
You ought to know why Im so sure
