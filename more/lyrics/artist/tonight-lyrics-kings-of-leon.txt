Tonight, somebody's lover
Is gonna pay for a sin
It's coming on, it's coming on
I don't know, just what is leading me
Or if time is on my side
It's coming on, it's coming on
I don't know why I keep acting this way
And everybody knows it's strange
And it's something along the way
Something along the way
Well my seat, lights on Broadway
I know it's gonna be a long night
It's coming on, it's coming on
I don't know why I keep acting this way
And everybody knows it's strange
And it's something along the way
Something along the way
A hole in my head, I can feel it all
The neon lights my way
And it's something along the way
There's something along the way
Tonight, gonna leave my body
Tonight, gonna leave my body
Tonight, somebody's lover
Is gonna pay for his sin
It's coming on, it's coming on
I don't know why I keep acting this way
And everybody knows it's strange
And it's something along the way
Something along the way
A hole in my head, I can feel it all
The neon lights the way
And it's something along the way
There's something along the way
Gonna leave my body
Tonight, gonna leave my body
