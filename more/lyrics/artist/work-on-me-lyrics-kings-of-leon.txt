rock
Rise and shine
Get on your way
By the look in your eyes there's nothing to say
I got it all
In my hands
And I know that you know just where I stand
Where we stand
One more thing
Before you go
Pick it up and then I'll hit it on down the road
I got no time
For playing games
I mean that I'm out and it's always the same
It's always the same
Ooo, I strut like a cock
And Jack don't rock
It's all coming back to me
Oh what a shame
If it's all the same
I'll get on my coat and leave
No way you're gonna work
No way you're gonna work
No way you're gonna work on me
I said that before
I open the door
Why is that so hard to believe?
Pick that guitar
Up in the air
Cut it loose and then let down that hair
I know that you
Were born to shine
You got a shine before you're blown away
You're blown away
Ooo, I strut like a cock
And Jack don't rock
It's all coming back to me
Oh what a shame
If this is all the same
I'll get on my coat and leave
No way you're gonna work
No way you're gonna work
No way you're gonna work on me
I said that before
I open the door
Why is that so hard to believe?/
Get on your way
Get on your way
Get on your way
Get on your way
I strut like a cock
And Jack don't rock
Get on your way
Oh what a shame
If it's all the same
Get on your way
No way you're gonna work
No way you're gonna work
Get on your way
I told you before
I open the door
Get on your way
Get on your way
