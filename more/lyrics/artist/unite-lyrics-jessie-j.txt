[Verse 1]
Come here now - sit by me
tonight lets light a fire
Keep me warm - with your sweet loving -
two hearts beating
[Pre 1]
I feel the blood rush through my head
As i prepare for life - to begin tonight (oh)
I feel the blood rush through my heart
As i prepare to fly - as we unite - (oh)
[Chorus 1]
We unite - we beat the drum
for love tonight
We unite- we gotta beat it right
We unite - we gotta shout this love into the sky
You and I - we unite - (lets go)
Wo oh oh (oh) Wo oh oh (oh)
Wo oh oh (oh) Wo oh oh (lets go)
Wo oh oh (oh) Wo oh oh (oh)
Wo oh oh (oh)
We unite
[Verse 2]
Skin on skin
Our arms pressing - our lips kissing
Feel the wind feel the precious breeze -
while you're far from me yeah
[Pre 2]
I feel the blood rush through my head
As i prepare for life - to begin tonight (woah)
I feel the blood rush through my heart
As i prepare to fly - as we unit - (woah)
[Chorus 2]
We unite - we beat the drum
for love tonight
We unite- we gotta beat it right
We unite - we gotta shout this love into the sky
You and I - we unite - (lets go)
Wo oh oh (oh) Wo oh oh (oh)
Wo oh oh (oh) Wo oh oh (lets go)
Wo oh oh (oh) Wo oh oh (oh)
Wo oh oh (oh)
We unite
[Bridge 1]
Our bodies in a tug of war (oh oh oh)
Till our feet don't touch the floor (oh oh oh)
Sink into this give me more (oh oh oh)
More more more more
[Verse 1 Repeat]
Come here now - sit by me
tonight lets light a fire
Keep me warm - with your sweet loving
[Chorus 3]
We unite - we beat the drum
for love tonight
We unite- we gotta beat it right
We unite - we gotta shout this love into the sky
You and I - we unite - (lets go)
Wo oh oh (oh) Wo oh oh (oh)
Wo oh oh (oh) Wo oh oh (lets go)
Wo oh oh (oh) Wo oh oh (oh)
Wo oh oh (oh)
We unite
