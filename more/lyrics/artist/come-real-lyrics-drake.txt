Drake
hiphop
Verse 1: *Drake*
Ive always wondered why you bothered putting make up on
you dont need it
Even tho I always tell you that your beautiful
I repeat cuz I dont want no singer and I dont want no model I dont want no fashion designer or nothing
I jus want your love
Telling you thats more than enuff 4 me
(Chorus)
All you gotta do is
Come real
Shawty whats da deal dont think jus cuz your simple that you lose your appeal
I wouldnt have it any other way
All you gotta do is
Come real
Shawty whats da deal dont think jus cuz your simple that you lose your appeal
I wouldnt have it any other way hey ay ay ayy
Verse 2: *Kyoko*
Baby jus becuz I wanna look good dont think I aint real
Not in the least bit
All the clothes and the doing of my hair face nails makes me feel good
Nd ill keep it up on da 10
What you been sayin to me aint exactly what I need to feel and kno
Yur da one im wearin for and where I will always go when I need a reason to
(Chorus)
Stay real
What you make me feel
Its tru beauty is the ultimate appeal
and I dont want it any other way hey ay ay ayy
To stay real
What you make me feel
Its tru beauty is the ultimate appeal
And I dnt wnt it any other way hey ay ayy
