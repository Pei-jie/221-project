[Verse 1]
(Last night) Our lovers quarrel (I was thinking about you)
Hurts more than I can say (And it was kind of dirty)
Oh my (And the way that you looked at me)
Help me here! (It was kind of nasty, aah!)
Help me here! (It was kind of trashy)
Cause I can't help my mind from going there!
[Pre-Chorus]
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do...
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you
[Chorus]
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (don't stop the party)
Making love in my sex dreams (4x)
[Verse 2]
We could be caught (I just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought (cause I'm broken)
Let's white- (by the one before) glove the bed
(He was kind of nasty)
Help me here!
(And I feel so trashy)
Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads!
[Chorus 2]
Last night
Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams (you were in my)
Making love in my Sexxx dreams
Don't stop the party (Making love in my Sexxx dreams)
Let's keep it naughty (Making love in my Sexxx dreams)
Watch me act a fool (Making love in my Sexxx dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you, Tomorrow when I run into you
[Bridge]
You could turn a stone
Or the color of a man petrified by a woman
In love as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him
[Speaking]
I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple drinks
And oh my god
(*vomits and giggles*)
[Chorus 3]
Last night
Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams (You were in my)
Doing really nasty things (You were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams (you were in my)
Last night
Don't stop the party (Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams)
Let's keep it naughty (Doing really nasty things)
Watch me act a fool (Damn, you were in my Sexxx dreams)
Tomorrow when I run into you (Making love in my Sexxx dreams)
[iTunes Festival Bridge]
We were in the swimming pool. I was naked, so were you, and I wrote this song while we made love
Dangerous poetry rhymed with our bodies and now's the time for the trial with doubts and drawls
(I can't believe I'm telling you this, but I've had a couple of drinks and, oh my god-- [vomits and laughs])
