Hey! I ain't looking at you
For no particular reason!
Its just the right spot for me to be in
I gotta open that door
Hey, it gotta get open hey, hey!
I'mma push my way through, just like a rubber
And smile for the camera
Damn, I feel awesome!
But she does a little more
Gotta get it open!
Hook:
You never listen when I need someone to talk to
So you switch the subject
Because its beyond you.
When you talk about your dreams, I'm never included
I need to stop sleeping on myself
Wake up and do it on my own!
I'll find a way, yeah
And I'll do it on my own, hey!
I can do anything, yeah
Can't you get it done with the help of no one
I came into this world by myself
So I don't need nobody else!
Think I just begun,
So much I do, so young
Don't be afraid to be alone
You'll get it done on your own!
Uh, uh, uh!
I know you're in there
Open up, open up!
Just like the feds, looking for the subs
Three knocks at the door
I gotta get it open!
I'm so confused with all the traffic
I'mma skip the lane/line
Who cares where I have been?
I gotta stay on that course
I gotta get it open!
