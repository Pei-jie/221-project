Harry:
Give you this, give you that
Blow a kiss, take it back
If I look inside your brain
I would find lots of things
Clothes, shoes, diamond rings
Stuff that's driving me insane
Harry:
You could be preoccupied
Different date, every night
You just got to say the word
You're not into them at all
You just want materials
I should know because I've heard
The girls say...
Together:
I want, I want, I want (Louis: But that's crazy)
l want, I want, I want (Louis: And that's not me)
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you
Liam:
You've got everything you need
But you want accesories
Got to hold it in your hand
If I change the world for you
I bet you wouldn't have a clue
Don't you know that I can't stand
When girls say...
Together:
I want, I want, I want, (Harry: But that's crazy)
I want, I want, I want, (Niall: And that's not me)
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you
Louis:
Oh, and all the the girls say
Together:
I want, I want, I want, (Liam: But that's crazy)
I want, I want, I want, (Niall: And that's not me)
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you
Zayn:
Be loved by you
I wanna, I stay true
I wonder if you knew
What you put me through
But you want, you want, you want me to love you too
Liam:
I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, but that's not me
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you
Zayn:
Oh, and all the girls say
Together:
I want, I want, I want, (Louis: But that's crazy)
I want, I want, I want, (Niall: And that's not me)
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you
I want, I want, I want, (Harry: And all the girls say)
I want, I want, I want, (Zayn: and that's crazy)
I want, I want, I want, to be loved by you
