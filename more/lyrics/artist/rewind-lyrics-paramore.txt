Paramore
rock
Don't come looking for me
'Cause I'll be right here
With the words you said
I'm looking for the words to say
You know what you did, you know
How can anybody forget
The promise that you made?
'Cause this is how the promise breaks
I always knew you'd fall through
And now you're proof
Rewind to the first time
And I felt it coming
I knew it would not last
Rewind to the first time
And I felt it coming
Make it quick
Make it painless
Don't tell me lies
Just say goodbye
And now you're running from me
So cool, so scared of what you might have said
And no one's ever looked away
'Cause we know what you did, we know
If I told anybody
Then we would soon forget your name
And you would never have a place
I always knew you'd fall through
And now you're proof
Rewind to the first time
And I felt it coming
I knew it would not last
Rewind to the first time
And I felt it coming
Make it quick
Make it painless
Don't tell me lies
Just say goodbye
Please don't say too much
Oh, I think we've heard enough from you
Rewind to the first time
And I felt it coming
I knew it would not last
Rewind to the first time
And I felt it coming
Make it quick
Make it painless
Don't tell me lies
Just say goodbye
Don't tell me lies
Just say goodbye
