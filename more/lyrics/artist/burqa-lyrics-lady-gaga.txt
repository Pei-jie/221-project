I killed my former and
Left her in the trunk on Highway 10
Put the knife under the hood If you find it
Send it straight to Hollywood
Hahahaha Hahahaha Hahahaha
Aura-a-a-a Aura-a-a-a
I'm not a wandering slave
I am a woman of choice
My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face
You want to fancy me cause there's always one man to love
But in the bedroom,
The size of them's more than enough
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover
Do you wanna be the peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura
Behind the aura, Behind the aura, Behind the aura
Enigma popstar is fun
She wear burqa for fashion
It's not a statement as much as just a move of passion
I may not walk on your street
Or shoot a gun on your soil
I hear you screaming
Is it because of pleasure and toil
Dance, Sex ,ART POP, Dance, Sex, ART POP
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna be peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover
Do you wanna be the peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura, Behind the aura, Behind the curtain, Behind the burqa.
