[Erin Christine:]
The way, the way
You just seem to have the right timin.
In love with me.
You grab my hand cause your not hiding
When I'm insecure... you show the world your mine
There are the days,
You and I just aren't fighting
You call then I call, and
You wait so long before replying
And everytime you ask me will we be okay
You know I'll say, when I see your face
All the bad s-s go away,
Cause we're amazing just the way we are.
So I will stay... even when it's not our day
Cause we're amazing just the way we are.
[Bruno Mars:]
Her lips, her lips,
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Oh you know, you know, you know
Id never ask you to change
If perfect is what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking
If you look okay
You know I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile,
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
The way you are
The way you are
Girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile,
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah-eah
