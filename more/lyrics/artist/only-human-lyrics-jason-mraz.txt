rock
A squirrel in the tree, is he watching me?
Does he give a damn? Does he care who I am?
Im just a man, is that all I am?
Are my manners misinterpreted words or only human?
Im human
Murderous crow, hey, what you know?
What you reading about? What you hold in your toes?
Is that a twig? Are you a dove of peace?
Black dove undercover with another puzzle piece
Are you a riddle to solve all along?
Or am I overthinking thoughts, I'm human after all
Only human, made of flesh, made of sand
Made of human
The planets talking about a revolution
The natural laws aint got no constitution
Theyve got a right to live their own life
But we keep paving over paradise
Cause were only human
Oh yes we are, only human
If its our only excuse, do you think well keep on being only human?
Oh yes we are, only human, so far, so far
Up in the majors tree
The one he planted back when he was just a boy
Back in 1923
Thirty meters and a foot, take a look, take a climb
What youll find is the product of a seed
The seed is sown, all alone
It grows above with a heart of love
A sharpened shelter of
The animals of land and cold weather breathing
Were all breathing
The planets talking about a revolution
The natural laws aint got no constitution
Theyve got a right to live their own life
But we keep paving over paradise
Cause were only human
Oh yes we are, only human
If its our only excuse, do you think well keep on being only human?
Oh yes we are, only human, so far, so far
And this place it will outlive me
Before I get to heaven Ill climb that tree
And I will have to give my thanks
For giving me the branch to swing on
If I ever fall in love
Ill hope to give myself a baby
I will let my children have their way
Because were only human
Oh yes we are, only human, so far, so far
So far, so far
