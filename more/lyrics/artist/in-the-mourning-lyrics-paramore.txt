Paramore
rock
You escape like a runaway train
Off the tracks and down again
My heart's beating like a steamboat tugging all your burdens
On my shoulders
In the mourning I'll rise
In the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning. All my worry.
And now there's nothing but time that's wasted
And words that have no backbone
Now it seems like whole world 's waiting
Can you hear the echoes fading?
In the mourning I'll rise
In the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning. All my sorry's.
And it takes all my strength not to dig you up
From the ground in which you lay
The biggest part of me,
You were the greatest thing
And now you're just a memory
To let go of
In the mourning I'll rise
In the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning. all my sorry's.
In the mourning I'll rise
In the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning. all my sorry's.
