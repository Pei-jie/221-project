Drums keep pounding a rhythm to, to the brain
Wait till you have reached the age
History has turned the page
We still want to hear a brand new thing
We still need a song to sing
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to, to the brain
Love is the first thing and last thing on our minds
From tomorrow until the end of time
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes
And the beat goes
And the beat goes on
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to, to the brain
We still move to a rhythm just like this
We still dream of sharing our first kiss
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
And the beat goes on
Drums keep pounding a rhythm to, to the brain
The world keeps on turning faster everyday
(Everyday)
We still want to dance the night away
And the beat goes on and on and on
And the beat goes on and on and on
And the beat goes on and on and on
And the beat goes on and on and on
And the beat goes on and on and on
And the beat goes on and on and on
