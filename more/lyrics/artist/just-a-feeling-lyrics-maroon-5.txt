rock
I watched you cry, bathe in sunlight by the bathroom door
You said you wish you did not love me anymore
You left your flowers in the backseat of my car
The things we said may have left permanent scars
Obsessed, depressed at the same time
I can't even walk in a straight line
I'm a light in the dark, no sunshine
No sunshine, no sunshine
She cries, "This is more than goodbye
When I look into your eyes
You're not even there"
It's just a feeling, just a feeling, just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling, just a feeling that I have
'Cause it's just a feeling, just a feeling, just a feeling
(I can't believe that it's over)
You've hit your low
You've lost control, you want him back
You may not believe me but I gave you all I had
Undressed, confessed that you're still mine
I rolled around in a bed full of tears and I
I'm still lying in the dark, no sunshine
No sunshine, no sunshine
She cries, "This is more than goodbye
When I look into your eyes
You're not even there"
It's just a feeling, just a feeling, just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling, just a feeling that I have
'Cause it's just a feeling, just a feeling, just a feeling
(No, I can't believe that it's over now)
It's just a feeling, just a feeling that I have
So much to say it's not the way she does her hair
It's the way she seems to stare right through my eyes
And in that darkest day that she refused to run away
From love she tried so hard to save
It's just a feeling, just a feeling, just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling, just a feeling that I have
It's just a feeling
It's just a feeling, just a feeling, just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling, just a feeling that I have
It's just a feeling, just a feeling, just a feeling that I have
(I can't believe that it's over)
Just a feeling, just a feeling that I have
(I can't believe that it's over)
And I can't believe that it's over, yeah
