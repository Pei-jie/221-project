rock
Well, I saw fireworks from the freeway
And behind closed eyes I cannot make them go away
'Cause you were born on the fourth of July, freedom ring
Now something on the surface it stings
I said something on the surface well it kind of makes me nervous
Who says that you deserve this and what kind of God would serve this?
We will cure this dirty old disease
Well if you gots the poison I gots the remedy
The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end
I, I won't worry my life away
I, I won't worry my life away
Well, I heard two men talking on the radio
In a cross fire kind of new reality show
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack
They were counting down the ways to stab the brother
In the be right back after this, the unavoidable kiss
Where the minty fresh death breath
Is sure to outlast this catastrophe, dance with me
'Cause if you gots the poison, I've gots the remedy
The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end
I, I won't worry my life away
I, I won't worry my life away
When I fall in love I take my time
There's no need to hurry when I'm making up my mind
You can turn off the sun but I'm still gonna shine
And I'll tell you why, because
The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end
I, I won't worry my life away
I, I won't worry my life away
I, I won't worry my life away
...
thank you
