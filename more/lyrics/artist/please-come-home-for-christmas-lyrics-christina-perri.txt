Bells will be ringing the glad, glad news
Oh what a christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone i have no friends
To wish me greetings once again
Choirs will be singing silent night
Those christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for christmas
Please come home for christmas
If not for christmas by new year's night
Friends and relations send salutations
Just as sure as the stars shine above
This is christmas, christmas my dear
The time of year to be with the one that you love
Then won't you tell me, you'll never more roam
Christmas and new year will find you at home
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief or pain
I'll be happy (happy) that it's christmas once again
