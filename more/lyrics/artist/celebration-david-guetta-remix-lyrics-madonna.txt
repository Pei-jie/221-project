Madonna
pop
Under the strobe lights
We can let go of it all
After midnight, partying until tomorrow
Whatever happens tonight
Just stay right by my side
So let's enjoy this celebration
Come join the party, it's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started, no more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
I think you wanna come over
Yeah, I heard it through the grapevine
Are you drunk? Are you sober?
Think about it, doesn't matter
And if it makes you feel good, then I say do it
I don't know what you're waiting for
Feel my temperature rising
It's too much heat, I'm gonna lose control
Do you want to go higher?
Get closer to the fire
I don't know what you're waiting for
Under the strobe lights
We can let go of it all
After midnight, partying until tomorrow
Whatever happens tonight
Just stay right by my side
So let's enjoy this celebration
Come join the party, it's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started, no more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
Boy, you got a reputation
I see a little hesitation, am I gonna have to show you
That if it feels right, get on your mark
Step to the beat boy, that's what it's for
Put your arms around me
When it gets too hot we can go outside
But for now just come here, let me whisper in your ear
An invitation to the dance of life
Under the strobe lights
We can let go of it all
After midnight, partying until tomorrow
Whatever happens tonight
Just stay right by my side
So let's enjoy this celebration
Come join the party, it's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started, no more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
I got you burning up girl coz Im on fire
Turn it up girl u cant deny
Ain't enough words to make me fly
I got the bang bang boogie to make you high.
I know they told you that I was trouble break it down girl I aint gonna lie
used to wanna come closer to me or are u shy
Let me wrap my arms around you baby girl
Couldn't match this night if I searched all around the world
Spinning you round in a circle
In the middle of the dance floor
Under the strobe lights
We can let go of it all
After midnight, partying until tomorrow
Whatever happens tonight
Just stay right by my side
So let's enjoy this celebration
Come join the party, it's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started, no more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
Come join the party, it's a celebration
'Cause anybody just won't do
Let's get this started, no more hesitation
'Cause everybody wants to party with you
(Celebration)
