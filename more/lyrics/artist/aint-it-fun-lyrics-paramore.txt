Paramore
rock
I don't mind
Letting you down easy but just give it time
If it dont hurt now just wait, just wait a while
Youre not the big fish in the pond no more
You are what they're feeding on
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you?
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you?
Ain't it fun?
Living in the real world
Ain't it good?
Being all alone
Where you're from,
You might be the one who's running things
Where you could ring anybody's bell and get what you want
You see its easy to ignore trouble
When youre living in a bubble
So what are you gonna do
When the world dont orbit around you?
So what are you gonna do
When nobody wants to fool with you?
Ain't it fun?
Living in the real world
Ain't it good?
Being all alone
Ain't it good to be on your own?
Ain't it fun, you can't count on no one
Ain't it good to be on your own?
Ain't it fun, you can't count on no one
Ain't it fun?
Living in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama
Cause youre on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama
Cause youre on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama
Cause youre on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama
Cause youre on your own in the real world
Ain't it fun? Ain't it fun? Baby, now youre one of us
Ain't it fun? Ain't it fun? Ain't it fun?
Ain't it fun?
Living in the real world
Ain't it good? Ain't it good?
Being all alone
Ain't it fun?
Living in the real world (Cause the world don't orbit around you)
Ain't it good? Ain't it good?
Being all alone
Don't go crying to your mama (To your mother)
Cause you're on your own in the real world (Don't go crying)
Don't go crying to your mama (To your mama)
Cause youre on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama
Cause you're on your own in the real world (This is the real world)
Don't go crying to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world (This is the real world, this is the real world)
Don't go crying to your mama (Don't go crying)
'Cause youre on your own in the real world
Don't go crying to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go crying (Don't you go, don't you go crying)
Don't go crying (You're on your own)
Don't go crying (Don't go crying to your mother)
Don't go crying
