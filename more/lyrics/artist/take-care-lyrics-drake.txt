I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself.
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost.
[Drake: verse 1]
I've asked about you and they've told me things
but my mind didn't change it
I still feel the same
what's a life with no fun, please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours we both know, we know.
They don't get you like I will
my only wish is I die real
cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
and you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
so you cry still, tears all in the pillow case,
big girls all get a little taste
pushing me away so I give her space
dealing with a heart that I didn't break.
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you, just don't know
try to run from that, say you're done with that
on your face girl, it just don't show.
When you're ready, just say you're ready
when all the baggage just ain't as heavy
and the parties over, just don't forget me
we'll change the pace and we'll just go slow.
You won't ever have to worry,
you won't ever have to hide,
you've seen all my mistakes,
so look me in my eyes.
[Rihanna]
'Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and i've lost you.
[Drake: verse 2]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if have to
cause you don't say you love me
to your friends when they ask you
even though we both know that you do (you do).
One time, been in love one time
you and all your girls in the club one time
all so convinced that you're following your heart
cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes.
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know.
You hate being alone
you ain't the only one
you hate the fact that you bought the dream
and they sold you one
you love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somin',
to save you, instead he said;
don't a-ha-ha-ha-ha,
tell me a-ha-ha-ha-ha,
I don't care a-ha-ha-ha-ha,
If you're hurt a-ha-ha-ha-ha.
I won't a-ha-ha-ha-ha,
tell you a-ha-ha-ha-ha,
you don't care a-ha-ha-ha-ha,
if you're true a-ha-ha-ha-ha,
don't a-ha-ha-ha-ha,
tell me a-ha-ha-ha-ha,
I don't care a-ha-ha-ha-ha,
If you're hurt a-ha-ha-ha-ha.
I won't a-ha-ha-ha-ha,
tell you a-ha-ha-ha-ha,
you don't care a-ha-ha-ha-ha,
if you're true a-ha-ha-ha-ha,
