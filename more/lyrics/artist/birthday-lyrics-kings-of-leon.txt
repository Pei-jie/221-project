rock
It's in the way she often calls me out
It's in the cut of your pretty gown
Your come-on legs and your pantyhose
You look so precious with your bloody nose
We're gonna come together, we're gonna celebrate
We're gonna gather around like it's your birthday
I don't wanna know just what I'm gonna do
I don't care where you're going
I'm coming home with you
Walking her home with the grassy field
Falling and laughing at the drinks we spill
Just one of those nights that I have to share
Chasing the death without a care
We're gonna come together, we're gonna celebrate
We're gonna gather around like it's your birthday
I don't wanna know just what I'm gonna do
I don't care where you're going
I'm coming home with you
You know I love the way you curve
Yeah
We're gonna come together, we're gonna celebrate
We're gonna get around like it's your birthday
I don't wanna know just what I'm gonna do
I don't care where you're going
I'm coming home with you
