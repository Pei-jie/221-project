Its complicated
It always is
Thats just the way it goes
Feels like I waited so long for this
I wonder if it shows
head under water
Now i can't breath
It never felt so good
Cause i can feel it coming over me
I wouldnt stop it if i could
When love takes over (yeah-ah-eah)
You know you cant deny
When love takes over (yeah-ah-eah)
Cause somethings here tonight
Give me a reason
I gotta know
Do you feel it too?
Cant you see me here on over load
And this time I blame you
Looking out for you to hold my hand
It feels like I could fall
Now love me right, like I know you can
We could lose it all
When love takes over (yeah-ah-eah)
You know you cant deny
When love takes over (yeah-ah-eah)
Cause somethings here tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight (keep saying)
I'll be loving you all the time
its true.Cause i wanna make it right
with you
...
When love takes over(x6)
when love takes over over over over over
over over over over over over!
When love takes over (yeah-ah-eah)
You know you cant deny
When love takes over (yeah-ah-eah)
Cause somethings here tonight
