I just can't sleep tonight
Knowing that things ain't right
It's in the papers, it's on the TV, it's everywhere that I go
Children are crying, soldiers are dying, some people don't have a home
But I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Hey, can you tell me how I can make a change?
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I lose my appetite knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner, 'cause half my dinner is still on my plate?
Ooh I got a vision to make a difference
And it's starting today
'Cause I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Can you tell me how I can make a change?
I close my eyes and I can see a brighter day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray for the brokenhearted
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the ones not breathing
I pray for all the souls in need
I pray, can you give 'em one today?
I just can't sleep tonight
Can someone tell me how to make a change?
I close my eyes and I can see a brighter day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and I pray, I pray, I pray
I close my eyes and pray, pray, pray, pray
