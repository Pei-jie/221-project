My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny that when he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a L.A. crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart
Swimming pool, glimmering darling
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples, you
Sittin', sippin' on your black Cristal, oh yeah
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Give me them gold coins
Give me them coins
Now I'm off to the races, cases
Of Bacardi chasers
Chasin' me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted, facin'
Time again at Riker's
Island and I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet starlet
Singin' in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you
My old man is a tough man
But he got a soul as sweet as blood-red jam
And he shows me he knows me
Every inch of my tar-black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat broke-down life
In fact, he says he thinks it's what he might like about me
Admires me, the way I roll like a rolling stone
Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom
Chateau Marmont
Slippin' on my red dress
Puttin' on my make-up
Glass film, perfume, cognac, lilac
Fumes, says it feels like heaven to him
Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me, gimme them coins
And I'm off to the races, cases
Of Bacardi chasers
Chasin' me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted, facin'
Time again at Riker's
Island and I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet starlet
Singin' in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Yo, I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is
Tight and I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you but I'm going down
God, I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raisin' hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it
My old man is a thief, and I'm gonna stay and pray with him till the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord to watch over us
Take him when he may, if he may
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'd never leave you
They would rue the day I was alone without you
You're lyin' with your gold chain on, cigar hanging from your lips
I said, "Hun, you never looked so beautiful as you do now, my man"
And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is
Down and now we're goin' in
To Las Vegas, chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin
Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love
You are my one true love
