It is so easy to see
Dysfunction between you and me
We must free up these tired souls
Before the sadness gets us both
I tried and tried to let you know
I love you but I'm letting go
It may not last but I don't know
Just don't know
If you don't know then you can't care
And I show up but you're not there
But I'm waiting and you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you
Everyday with every word whispered
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing last forever but be honest, babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
A web that's warm with memories
Can heal us temporarily
The misbehaving all it makes
The ditch between us so damn deep
Built a wall around my heart
Never let it fall apart
Strangely I wish secretly
It won't fall down while I'm asleep
If you don't know then you can't care
And I show up but you're not there
But I'm waiting and you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you, babe
Everyday with every word whispered
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing last forever but be honest, babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
But we have not hit the ground
Doesn't mean we're not still falling
I want so bad to pick you up
But you're still too reluctant to accept my help
What a shame
I hope you find somewhere
To place the blame
But until then the fact remains
Everyday with every word whispered
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
Nothing last forever, but be honest, babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
Everyday with every word whispered
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing last forever, but be honest, babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
