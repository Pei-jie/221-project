[Verse 1]
Bitter sweet thing, could this be a dream
Or just the same nightmare that keeps me awake
Feel it in my brain, tall shot of pain
Pour a little up now, for the love that we made
I feel it in the morning, you're still here in the morning
I see you, but you gone. Telephone the doctor, I'm not okay
The bottom of the bottle, to fill this empty heart up
A thousand proof don't change the truth
I dive in, but I can't
[Chorus]
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim,
I've tried all of them brands
But I can't drink you away
All these rocks, I can't swim out of this skin I'm living in, say
Now tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heart break
Ohh, tell me baby, oh yeah
Now don't they make a medicine for heart break
Got a pounding on my brain, so I drowned it away
When the sun comes up tomorrow
You can find me doing the same
'Cause I just can't forget
The way we turned out this bed
And now the only thing that sleeps here is a ghost of you instead
I feel it in the morning, you're still here in the morning
I see you, but you gone. Telephone the doctor, I'm not okay
The bottom of the bottle, to fill this empty heart up
A thousand proof don't change the truth
I dive in, but I can't
[Chorus]
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim,
I've tried all of them brands
But I can't drink you away
All these rocks, I can't swim out of this skin I'm living in, say
Now tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heart break
Ohhh, tell me baby, oh yeah
Now don't they make a medicine for heart break
I can't drink you, no I can't drink you away, away
I can't drink you, I can't drink you away, away
I can't drink you, I can't drink you away, away
I can't drink you, no I can't drink you away
[Chorus]
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim,
I've tried all of them brands
But I can't drink you away
All these rocks, I can't swim out of this skin I'm living in, say
Now tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heart break
Ohh, tell me baby, oh yeah
Now don't they make a medicine for heart break
Tell me, baby
Can't they make a medicine for my heart break, heart break
Tell me baby,
Can't they make a medicine for my heart break
[Chorus]
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim,
I've tried all of the brands
I can't drink you away
All these rocks, I can't swim out of this skin I'm living in
