pop
When the sun goes down, down, down, down
Boy you're afraid of the dark, dark
And when the lights go out, out, out, out
Tell me do you know where to start, start
And when the base gets loud, loud, loud
That is when I feel apart, apart
And when the world sleeps sound, sound, sound, sound
Well the sound is the key of my heart
Chorus:
We run.. a yes, we run the night, the night
We run .. a yes, we run the night,
night, night, night, night
We run .. a yes, we run the night,
we, we, we, run
We run .. a yes, we run the night,
the night, night, night, night
Run 'em, like run 'em, run 'em
Run 'em, like run 'em, run 'em
Feelin like a rush, rush, rush
Pushing passed me, all over my skin, skin
I can get enough 'nough 'nough 'nough
'cause the beat keeps pullin' me in
Taking me so high up, up, up
A place that I've never been, ahhhh

Chorus:
We run.. a yes, we run the night, the night
We run .. a yes, we run the night,
night , night, night, night
We run .. a yes, we run the night, we, we, we, run
We run.. a yes, we run the night, the night.
Run 'em, like run 'em, run 'em
Run 'em, like run 'em, run 'em
