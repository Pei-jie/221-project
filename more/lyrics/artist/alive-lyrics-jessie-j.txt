[Verse 1]
This is it now it's in our hands
I know you feel it
We could have quit but we choose to dance
B best believe it
[Pre 1]
We took it in baby from the start
We chased the light and forgot the dark
So paint this moment with a million stars stars
So everybody sing with me
[Chorus 1]
Let me see your hands up high
Don't wait own it because tonight
We're flying free like birds in the sky
'Coz we're alive alive
Let's raise a glass to you and I
Let's show and tell that we survive
We're flying free like birds in the sky
'Coz we're alive
1 2 3 We're alive 1 2 3 So alive
1 2 3 We're alive 1 2 3 So alive
Alive alive
[Verse 2]
Here we are now it's in our hands
Oh yeah we feel it
Don't let it stop we got to dance b best believe it
[Pre 2]
We took it in baby from the start
We chased the light and forgot the dark
So paint this moment with a million stars stars
So everybody sing with me
[Chorus 2]
Let me see your hands up high
Don't wait own it because tonight
We're flying free like birds in the sky
'Coz we're alive alive
