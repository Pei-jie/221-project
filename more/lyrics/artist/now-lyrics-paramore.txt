Paramore
rock
Dont try to take this from me,
Dont try to take this from me,
Na-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ow.
Dont try to take this from me,
Dont try to take this from me,
Na-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ow.
Feels like Im waking from the dead,
And everyones been waiting on me.
At least now I never have to wonder,
What its like to sleep a year away.
But werent we indestructible?
I thought that we could brave it all.
I never thought that what would take me out,
Was hiding down below.
Lost the battle, win the war!
Im bringing my sinking ship back to the shore.
Starting over, head back in!
Theres a time and a place to die,
But this aint it.
If theres a future we want it
Na-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ow!
If theres a future we want it
Na-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ow!
If theres a future we want it
Na-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ow!
If theres a future we want it
Na-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ow!
Dont try to take this from me,
Dont try to take this from me,
Na-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ow.
Dont try to take this from me,
Dont try to take this from me,
Na-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ow.
Wish I could find a crystal ball,
For the days I feel completely worthless.
You know Id use it all for good;
I would not take it for granted.
Instead Id have some memories,
For the days I don't feel anything.
At least they will remind me not to make the same mistakes again.
Lost the battle, win the war!
Im bringing my sinking ship back to the shore.
Starting over, head back in!
Theres a time and a place to die,
But this aint it.
If theres a future we want it
Na-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ow!
If theres a future we want it
Na-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ow!
If theres a future we want it
Na-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ow!
If theres a future we want it
Na-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ow!
Ooh
Theres a time and a place to die,
Theres a time and a place to die,
And this aint it.
Theres a time and a place to die,
And this aint it.
This aint it!
This aint it!
Theres a time and a place to die,
Theres a time and a place to die,
And this aint it,
Iiiiiiiiit!
If theres a future we want it
Na-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ow!
If theres a future we want it
Na-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ow!
If theres a future we want it
Na-ah-ah-ow!
If theres a future we want it
Na-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ow!
Na-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ow!
Na-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ow!
