Yeah
Lalala-a (lalala-a)
I coulda been the one you noticed
I coulda been the one for you
I coulda been like all the others
Is that what I'm supposed to do?
I don't wanna be disappointed,
and I don't want to have to prove
How I really feel about you
But would you even have a clue
I try to be sensitive
I try to be tough
I try to walk away...
I try to be innocent
I try to be rough
But I just wanna play
You're my daydream, you know that I've been thinking about you... lately
And everytime I look at you
I can't explain how I feel inside, I can't get away
You're my daydream
If I tell you what I'm thinking,
If I let myself trust you
Can you give me what I'm missing
Can you make my dreams come true
I try to be sensitive
I try to be tough
I try to walk away,
I try to be innocent
I try to be rough
But I just wanna play
You're my daydream, you know that I've been thinking about you... lately
And everytime I look at you
I can't explain how I feel inside, I can't get away
You're my daydream
I've always wanted someone
I've been waiting so long
Could you be that someone
Are you my, are you my, you're my, you're my-yy
You're my daydream, you know that I've been thinking about you... lately
And everytime I look at you
I can't explain how I feel inside, I can't get away
You're my daydream
And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know,
You're making me insane
And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know,
You're doin' it again
And you know, and you know, and you know, and you know,
You're making me insane
And you know, and you know, and you know,
You're doin' it again
