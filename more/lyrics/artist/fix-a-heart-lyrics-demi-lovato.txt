It's probably what's best for you
I only want the best for you
and if I'm not the best
then you're stuck
I tried to sever ties
and I ended up with wounds to bind
its like you're pouring salt in my cuts
And I just ran out of band aids
I don't even know where to start
cause you can bandage the damage
you never really can fix a heart
Even though i know what's wrong
how could I be so sure
if you never say what you feel, feel
I must have held your hand so tight
you didn't have the will to fight
I guess you needed more time to heal
Baby I just ran out of band aids
I don't even know where to start
cause you can bandage the damage
you never really can fix a heart
ohhh ohhh...
ohhh ooooh
oooh ooooh yeah ( x2)
You must be a miracle worker
swearing up and down you can fix
what's been broken yeah
please don't get my hopes up no no
baby tell me how could you be so cruel
It's like you're pouring salt on my cuts
Baby I just ran out of band aids
I don't even know where to start
cause you can bandage the damage
you never really can fix a heart
Baby I just ran out of band aids
I don't even know where to start
cause you can bandage the damage
you never really can fix a heart
oh no no no
you never really can fix a heart
oh no no noo
you never really can fix a heart
oh hoo ohhh
oh hoo yeah ohhh ohh ho oh oh oh
You never really can fix my heart
