My state of mind is finding out the best of me
I need you next to me
I'll try to find a way that I can
Get to you
I just wanna to get to you
The world I see is perfect now
You're all around
With you I can breath
Until You're Mine
I have to find a way
To fill this whole inside
I have to find
Way without you
Here by my side
Until You're Mine
Not gonna be
Even close to complete
I won't rest until you're mine (mine)
Alone inside I can
Only hear you voice
Ringing through the noise
I can find my mind it
Keeps on coming back to you
always leads back to you
I wanted something out of reach
It's killing me
You're all I see
Until You're Mine
I have to find a way
To fill this whole inside
I have to find
Way without you
Here by my side
Until You're Mine
Not gonna be
Able complete
I won't rest until you're mine (mine)
Yes i'm wondering
If we were meant to be
Forget about waiting just hold me
I'm ready to begin
The waiting has to end
Right now, Today
I have to find a way
Mine!
Until You're Mine
Without you here by my side
Until You're Mine
Not gonna be
Able complete
I won't rest until you're mine (mine)
My state of mind is finding out the best of me
I need you next to me
