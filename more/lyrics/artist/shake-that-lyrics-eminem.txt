Eminem
hiphop
Shady, Aftermath
There she goes shakin' that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk, get fucked up
Hit the strip club, don't forget ones, get ya dick rubbed, zip it up, get wasted, shit face-ted
Pasted, blasted, puke, drink, throw up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated til the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as them hips gyrated
And licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg here to sing somethin'
Two to the one, from the one, to the three
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one, from the one, to the three
I met a bad chick last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the mothafuckin mountain top
Heard mothafuckers talk, seen em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo' ass I'ma continue to rock
Getcha ass off the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close cause strobe lights blind
We about to have a party
(Turn the music up)
Let's get it started
(Go ahead an' shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act ********
Some girls are bout it bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the **** I say
Every day she be givin' it up
Shake that *** for me, shake that *** for me
C'mon girl, shake that *** for me, shake that *** for me
Oh girl, shake that *** for me, shake that *** for me
C'mon girl, shake that *** for me, shake that *** for me
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rininse
Swish but don't spit it, swallow and I'll finish, shh
Yeah, me and Nate D-O double G
Lookin' for a couple chickens with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple a dese
Mix it with her bubbly, we finna finna have a
We about to have a party
(Turn the music up)
Let's get it started
(Go ahead an' shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl I can **** in my Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big ol' ****
Some girls they act ********
Some girls are bout it bout it
I want a ***** that sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can, but she won't say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a s***, would you be mine?
I heard she was freaky from a friend of mine
Now I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a s***, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind
Shake that *** for me, shake that *** for me
C'mon girl, shake that *** for me, shake that *** for me
Oh girl, shake that *** for me, shake that *** for me
C'mon girl, shake that *** for me, shake that *** for me
We bout' to have a party
(Turn the music up)
Let's get it started
(Go ahead an' shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act ********
Some girls are bout it bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the **** I say
Every day she be givin' it up
There she goes, shakin' that *** on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losin' control
God, I'm old
I ain't leavin' without you *****
Come here, home with me
And my boy, and his boy, and his boy, and his girl, haha
Nate Dogg
