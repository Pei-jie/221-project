Stop, where am I?
Shock, I can't cry
Pop, I need some space
No, this isn't me
Go, please let me breathe
I'll be back sooner than you know
I need this space
Just like you need air
I need this time
Time to clear up my mind
Wait, did you hear that?
Hear my heart beat
I need this feeling
Yeah, I really need this
Wow, I've been blind
Hope I'll be fine
Don't hold me back, no
Yes, I see light
Now, it's alright
Call my name, I'll be me soon, whoa
I need this space
Just like you need air
I need this time
Time to clear up my mind
Wait, did you hear that?
Hear my heart beat
I need this feeling, oh
Wait, did you hear that?
Hear my heart beat
I need this feeling
Yeah, I really need this
I really need, I really need this
Really need, yeah
No it's not personal
Sorry if I'm hurting you
Please, don't give up on me now
I needed this time alone
To know I could come back home
To breathe, breathe, breathe
I need this space
Just like you need air
I need this time
Time to clear up my mind
Wait, did you hear that?
Hear my heart beat
I need this feeling
Wait, did you hear that?
Hear my heart beat
I need this feeling
I really need this
I need, need, need this feeling, whoa
I need this, I need, need, need, need this, yeah, yeah
Whoa, yeah
Really need, oh, ooh
I need, need, I really, really need
I need this, need this, need
I really need this
