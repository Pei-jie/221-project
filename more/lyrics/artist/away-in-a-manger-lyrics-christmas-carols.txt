Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus lay down His sweet head
The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep in the hay [repeat]
The cattle are lowing, the Baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
And stay by my side until morning is nigh,
sweet bells they ring, they ring out the news today,
that Christ was born, was born on Christmas day,
Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay
Close by me for ever and love me, I pray to
Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care
And take us to Heaven to live with Thee there
to live with thee there,
sweet bells they ring, they ring out the news today,
that Christ was born, was born on Christmas Day,
that Christ was born, was born on Christmas day.
