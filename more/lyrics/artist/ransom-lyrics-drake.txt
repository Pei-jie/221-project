Drake
hiphop
(Drake intro)
Yea
It's Drizzy baby
You already know what it is
It's the first time I'm high
It's the first time I've smoked in like 3 months
I'm sorry mamma I had to do it to 'em
Forty I see you
Oh I see you homie
I stay late tonight right?
You know what happen when I stay late, heh
Yea
Boi-1da
I swear it's like this every single time
Toronto I got you
I got us
Yea
(Drake [Lil' Wayne] verse 1)
I'm a hard guy to get along wit'
Get on a song wit'
When shit be going right
Well I just flip it to the wrong shit
The team that I belong to
The artists I put on wit'
Don't ever ask for nothin' 'cause them niggaz got they own shit
Me 'n Weezy like a mouthful of hot peppers
Black Ferrari with the red seats
I call it Playin' Checkers
I'm never doing verses
I'm forever giving lectures
If you're tryna meet with money
I'd be happy to connect ya
Life is, better than it's ever been
Scheduling million dollar meetings with the president
Someone cut the lights on
Where is Thomas Edison?
Got a new condo watch me as I settle in
I deserve a MTV show for me and my people
And if you tryna zone I got a whole Swisha Sweet full
Rappers are liars and they women are deceitful
Adding till they subtract me I never be a equal
Last place Drizzy is the nigga in the lead now
Weezy told me just write every single thing you need down
Then he got it for me and I'm happy as can be now
'Bout to start ballin' like I'm coming offa rebound
Yea
And I should have the most braggin' rights
Because a nigga spit crack, bag it tight
Hate when rappers say they tryna get they swagger right
'Cause I done came wit mo' fire than a dragon fight
Fuck you pussy ass hater you should do you
You ain't heard of me then you should go and get a Blue's Clue
[Oops I mean a red clue
Wayne's here, su woo]
Bet he felt that like the end of a pool cue
But I ain't bangin' I ain't wavin' no flag
I'm ATF but they ain't seein' no badge
It's Heartbreak Drake I hate to see 'em so sad
I could son you, see a little me in yo' dad
I'm the same yellow boy that used to play up on Degrassi
Can pocket twenty thousand to be anywhere they ask me
"Cash" like Johnny, "Banks" like Ashley
Burning like a Camel like
Stupid hoe ash me
But don't ask me shit about me
And know the game really ain't shit without me
She might have to pay me but I dick her down free
Wanna know if it's the truth then pull the zipper down and see
No homo dogg
(Lil' Wayne verse 2)
Yea
Ummm
I'm goin' in
Drizzy I got us
This is my promise
I'ma bring that barrel to them bitches eye liners
And what I make up would fuck up your skin
I pick the buck up and buck buck then buck buck again
I will butt fuck your friend then suck up her twin
I put the buck up to him then buck buck and buck buck and buck buck Again
Suck nut you duck fuck your unlovin' kin
Now don't rub it in
Like Lubriderm on a new tattoo I had to
Kick my princess up out my castle dad who
Never had that dude
Always had a black tool
Even when I was at school 'cuz bullies aren't bulletproof
Red scarf hoodie too
Probably ain't as hood as you
Stupid motherfucker the only thing in the hood is you
I do everything good as you no I do everything better
I get paid for every letter ABC etcetera
Fetch a bone, like a dog motherfucker
I am gone for you neck in a sec. intercept
Bring it back like work in the trunk and my exit comin' up yup
Ya I am headed for the buck like
Buck buck again might fly to L.A. and just fuck Karrine
Nah I fucked Karrine let's get bucks again
And fuckin' spend them bucks and then just fuck Karrine
If I told you I'ma do it I did it
Got my city on my fitted
'Bout to pop out let's get it
Let's get it motherfucker what you waitin' on
It is about a minute past pissed and I'm 'bout to get shitted
I'm wit' it if money is the it you want me with
And I'll probably just spit on the chick you won't be with
And I hate a bony bitch only like 'em only thick
And I own hip hop if you don't spit I'm gon' evict
And I just sold a lot of property to a buyer
And I think his name was kinda like Drake Drizzy Rogers or
Drizzy Drake Rogers I'm too busy to play father
And when it comes to the game I'm to willing to play harder
So harder I go, there he go
They chant MVP when I shoot a free-throw, CEO
Jazz' what it do?
The haters on their face and their ass is the shoe
Faster than you
Badder than you
Radder than you, et cetera
I told you I get paid by the letter like
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY
ZZ Top, yes he rocks
And me and Drizzy both wrote on Detox
That was just a foot note
How long can he could go?
Wonderin' when he stop?
Bitch when the beat stop
So I'ma keep rockin'
Till the sheet rock bend
And the heat I send
Burn skin
THE END
Young Moula baby, un huh
