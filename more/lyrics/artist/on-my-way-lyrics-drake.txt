Drake
hiphop
[Verse 1: Drake]
The clock that you've been watching has been stopping
He makes you wait
What kind of man does that to a girl he loves
If you just give tonight to me
I promise my hands are safe
There safe
Just in a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarm
Even though the traffic downtown don't show no mercy
Ohhh, think about the last time I came through
Had some more that I give for you
And I only fuck you like that on your birthday
Although baby I just landed
Out to get my bags in
All I need's an address and I'm on my way
Don't fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise it's worth waiting for
Because I'm on my way[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
Wont hurt just some turbulence with draw babe
Dont be afraid
If you fall right here in love with me in my bed
Ill keep you safe, so safe[Verse 2: Drake]
Less than a minute take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarm
Even though the traffic downtown don't show no mercy
Ohhh, think about the last time I came through
Had some more that I give for you
And I only fuck you like that on your birthday
Although baby I just landed
Out to get my bags in
All I need's an address and I'm on my way
Don't fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise it's worth waiting for
Because I'm on my way
