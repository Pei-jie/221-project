I found your hairband on my bedroom floor,
The only evidence that you'd been here before.
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore,
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never getting dry, so I get high, smoke away the days
Never sleep with the light on,
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye,
And I'm still drunk by the end of the night.
I don't drink like everybody else,
I tip it to forget things about myself,
Stumble and fall from the head spin I got ,
My minds with you but my hearts just not.
So am I close to you anymore, if it's over,
And there's no chance that we'll work it out,
That's why you and I ended over UNI
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over UNI
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
Everybody said we'd be together forever but I know that,
I never wanna settle down, come around, break up the love like lego now,
Never wanna turn into another like you,
Sleep with my thoughts. dance with my views,
Everything's great but not everything's sure,
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus,
Now I'm in position to be another stalker and every thing I say seems to always sound akward,
Like our last kiss it was perfect, we were nervous,
On the surface,
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it,
Pain is only relevent if it still hurts,
I forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative and go back to the day we fell in love,
Just on our first kiss.
So am I close to you anymore, if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out
That's why you and I ended over UNI
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I ended over UNI
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied
Wo-ooooahhhh [x2] oohh ohh
Because, if I was gonna go somewhere, I'd be there by now,
And maybe I can let myself down, wo-oahh
And thinking that I am unaware, I keep my feet on the ground, keep looking around, to make sure I'm not, the only one to feel low,
Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered, from all that I've done wrong
And I know you'll say, that I'm the only one
But I know God made another one of me to love you better than I ever will
'Cause you and I ended over UNI
and I said that's fine but you're the only one who knows that I lied
You and I ended over UNI
And I said that's fine but you're the only one who knows that I lied
