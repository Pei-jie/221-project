pop
(Verse)
I woke up and saw the sun today
You came by without a warning
You put a smile on my face
I want that for every morning
(Pre-Chorus)
What is it I'm feeling?
'Cause I can't let it go
If seeing is believing
Then I already know
(Chorus)
I'm falling fast
I hope this lasts
I'm falling hard for you
I say let's take a chance
Take it while we can
I know you feel it too
I'm falling fast
I'm falling fast yea
(Verse)
It doesn't matter what we do
You make everything seem brighter
I never knew I needed you
Like a sad song needs a sea of lighters
(Pre-Chorus)
What is it I'm feeling?
'Cause I can't let it go
If seeing is believing
I already know
(Chorus)
I'm falling fast
God, I hope this lasts
'Cause I'm falling hard for you
I say let's take a chance
Take it while we can
'Cause I know you feel it too
I'm falling fast
I'm falling fast yea
(Bridge x2)
I hope you know, I hope it lasts
I'm falling hard, I'm falling fast
We can go, no holding back
(Chorus)
I'm falling fast
I hope this lasts
I'm falling hard for you
I say let's take a chance
Take it while we can
I know you feel it too
I'm falling fast
I'm falling fast
