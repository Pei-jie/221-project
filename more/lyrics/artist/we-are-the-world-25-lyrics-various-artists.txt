We all need somebody that we can lean on
when you wake up look around and see that your dreams gone
when the earth quakes well help you make it through the storm
when the floor breaks a magic carpet to stand on
we are the World united by love so strong
when the radio isnt on you can hear the songs
a guided light on the dark road your walking on
a sign post to find the dreams you thought was gone
someone to help you move the obstacles you stumbled on
someone to help you rebuild after the rubbles gone
we are the World connected by a common bond
Love the whole planet sing it along
[Chorus - All]
