Did you forget that I was even alive?
Did you forget everything we ever had?
Did you forget, did you forget, about me?
Did you regret ever standing by my side?
Did you forget what we were feeling inside?
Now I'm left to forget about us
But somewhere we went wrong
We were once so strong
Our love is like a song
You can't forget it.
So now I guess this where we have to stand
Did you regret ever holding my hand?
Never again
Please don't forget, don't forget.
We had it all.
We were just about to fall even more in love
Than we were before.
I won't forget, I won't forget about us.
But somewhere we went wrong
We were once so strong
Our love is like a song
You can't forget it.
Somewhere we went wrong
We were once so strong
Our love is like a song
You can't forget it.
And at last all the pictures have been burnt.
And all the past is just a lesson that we've learned.
I won't forget, please don't forget, us.
But somewhere we went wrong
Our love is like a song
But you won't sing along
You've forgotten
About
Us.
