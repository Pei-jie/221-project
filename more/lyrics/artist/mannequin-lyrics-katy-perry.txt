How do I get closer to you
When you keep it all on mute?
How will I know the right way to love you?
Usually the queen of figuring out
Breaking down a man is no work out
But I have no clue
How to get through to you
Oh, I wanna hit you just to see if you cry
I keep knocking on wood
Hoping there's a real boy inside
'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man
I wish I could just turn you on
Put a battery in and make you talk
Even pull a string for you to say anything
But with you there is no guarantee
Only expired warranty
A bunch of broken parts
And I can't seem to find your heart
Oh, I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool
This one's outta my hands
I can't put you back together again
'Cause you're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man
You're just a toy
Could you ever be a real, real boy
And understand?
But you're not a man
If the past is the problem
Our future could solve them, baby
I could bring you to life if you let me inside, baby
It will hurt but in the end you'll be a man
You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
You're a toy
Could you ever be a real, real boy
And understand?
But you're not a man
You're not a man
You're just a mannequin
I wish you could feel that my love is real
But you're not a man
