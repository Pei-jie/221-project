You sent a text
It's like the wind changed your mind
We were best friends
Yeah, we were building our lives
With every kiss, and every letter
Every promise of forever, oh
But you hit send
And disappeared in front of my eyes
And now you're just a ghost
When I look back never would have known that
You could be so cold
Like a stranger vanish like a vapor
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now
Something is tight
Now that I have made up my mind
I'll be alright
It doesn't harm me at night
'Cause every gift, every letter, every promise of forever
Now, it's out of sight
Like you were never alive
And now you're just a ghost
When I look back never would have known that
You could be so cold
Like a stranger vanish like a vapor
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now
Now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now
So rest in peace
I see you on the other side
And now you're just a ghost
When I look back never would have known that
You could be so cold
Like a stranger vanish like a vapor
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's 20/20
I see through you now
Now, now, now, now
Oh, now, now, now, now
I see through you now
Now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now
I see through you now
