[Zayn]
Your hand fits in mine
Like its made just for me
But bear this in mind
It was meant to be
And Im joining up the dots
With the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
[Liam]
I know you've never loved
The crinkles by your eyes
When you smile,
You've never loved
Your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back
At the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly
CHORUS: [Zayn and Liam]
I won't let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
But if I do
Its you
Oh its you
They add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things
[Louis]
You can't go to bed
Without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason
That you talk in your sleep
And all those conversation
Are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
[Harry]
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me
CHORUS: [Harry and Niall]
I won't let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
but if its true
Its you
Oh its you
They add up to
I'm in love with you
And all these little things
[Niall]
You'll never love yourself
Half as much as I love you
You'll never treat yourself right darlin'
But I want you to
If I let you know
I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you
Oh..
[Harry]
I've just let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
Because its you
Oh its you
Its you
They add up to
And I'm in love with you
And all these little things
[All]
I won't let these little things
Slip out of my mouth
But if its true
Its you
Its you
They add up to
I'm in love with you
And all your little things
