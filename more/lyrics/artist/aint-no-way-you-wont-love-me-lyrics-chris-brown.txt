Ay, can I talk to you for a minute?
You new around here?
Girl ain't no way I would let you down
If you let me I will show you how
Ain't no way I'm gon let you down
I know it's hard right now to see it's in me
But I'm gon make you say you love me
The way you look to me now
We need to get down
Let's get down you don't know but
I'm gon make you say you love me, girl
I ain't never fell for a girl like you
With jeans and a body that curves like you
I don't really care what they say
When it comes to a difference of age
I can show you all the things I'll do
Break your heart, never raise my voice
Girl, let down your guard
I know it's a lot to ask trust in me
But I can make a difference right now, you'll see
Shorty, tell me
Why you tryna keep all the goodies from me?
Can't you see what you holding me now does to me?
Every time you walk past, oh
Ain't no way I'm gon let you down
I know it's hard right now to see it's in me
But I'm gon make you say you love me
The way you look to me now
We need to get down
Let's get down you don't know but
I'm gon make you say you love me girl
For a minute can you just think about us two?
Swervin' in my 645 SU, me leanin' over the seat
I'm passin' you your own set of keys
Showin' you just how the tea-, got you
Trust and believe these words from me been said before
Trickin' ain't my MO
Girl, you represent everything
That Chris is about, so shawty please
Shawty, tell me
Why you tryna keep all the goodies from me?
Can't you see what you holding me now does to me?
Every time you walk past, oh
Ain't no way I'm gon' let you down
I know it's hard right now to see it's in me
But I'm gon make you say you love me
The way you look to me now
We need to get down
Let's get down you don't know but
I'm gon make you say you love me, girl
For you girl I'll do anything
Just to have you close to me
'Cause you know your lovin' is off the wall
Can't nothin' can come about, we'll take it slow
I ain't like the ones you know
I'm gonna make you love me all night long
Ain't no way I'm gon' let you down
I know it's hard right now to see it's in me
But I'm gon' make you say you love me
The way you look to me now
We need to get down
Let's get down you don't know but
I'm gon make you say you love me, girl
