Once upon a time
Yeah I was in the dark
I was in your sight, with an open heart
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care
And now it's clear to me
And when I fell hard
You took a step back
Without me, (Yeah, I was dreaming for so long) , without me, without me
I wish I knew then
And he's long gone
Wouldn't dive in
When he's next to me
Gravity hurts
And I realize
('Till I woke up on)
On the concrete
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I've never been
'Till you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I've never been
Now I'm lying on the cold (On the concrete) hard ground
Oh, oh, (I'm Wide Awake) trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, (I'm Wide Awake) trouble, trouble, trouble
No apologies
Not losing any sleep
Pretend he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
Im wide awake,
Need nothing to complete myself
You're drowning, you're drowning, (Nooo) you're drowning
And I heard you moved on
Yeah, I am born again
Out of the lion's den
I don't have to pretend
And now I see, now I see, (The end) now I see
I wish I knew then
And he's long gone
Wouldn't dive in
When he's next to me
Gravity hurts
And I realize
('Till I woke up)
The joke is on me
Falling from cloud 9
[It was out of the blue when]
Crashing from the height
Im letting go tonight
[Yeah Im living a cold world]
Im falling from cloud 9
(Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground)
Oh, oh, (I'm Wide Awake) trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, (I'm Wide Awake) trouble, trouble, trouble
Then the saddest fear,(Crumbling) comes creeping in, (Crumbling)
Im wide awake
That you never loved me,
Or her, (Im wide awake) or anyone, (Im wide awake) or anything
Yeah-eah! (Im wide awake)
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now, (Im wide awake)
Flew me to places I've never been
'Till you put me down oh, (Im wide awake)
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now, (Im wide awake)
Flew me to places I've never been (Then I woke up)
Now I'm lying on the (On the concrete) cold hard ground
Falling from cloud 9 (trouble, trouble, trouble)
Crashing from the height (trouble, trouble, trouble)
Im letting go tonight (trouble, trouble, trouble)
Im falling from cloud 9 (trouble, trouble, trouble)
Trouble,
Im wide awake
