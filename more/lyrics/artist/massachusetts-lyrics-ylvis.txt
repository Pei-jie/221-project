pop
[Verse 1]
Far away across the oceans
An undiscovered paradise
Forget New York and California
There's a better place - now close your eyes
Take my hand
We are almost there
Our favorite place on earth
[Chorus]
Massachusetts
It's the 14th biggest state
Massachusetts
Just four hours from New York
Read amazing books for free at the Boston Library or try the local brie
Massachusetts
It's a melting pot, my friend
Massachusetts
So many cultures hand in hand
In perfect harmony
[Post-Chorus]
Welcome to the Massachusetts
Land of a thousand tribes
Home of Nelson Mandela
Fuck the apartheid
[Verse 2]
Come on boys of Attleboro
Catholic Priests of Haverhill
Staring dogs of the Suffolk County
Local dance group of Pingryville
Everyone
Living side by side
In the state of hope and dreams
[Chorus 2]
Massachusetts
I can't believe this place is real
Massachusetts
Can't describe the way I feel
I live with Steve and John
Mark and Christopher and Tom
Teddy P and Bruce
Massachusetts
The famous Massachusetts Bay
Massachusetts
Home of JF Kenneday
That tragically was shot
[Post-Chorus 2]
Just grab a friend and rent a car
Drive and drive across the Massachusetts
Just two friends hanging out together but never crossing the line
It's a thin, thin line
Oh, we're nothing more than friends
Just good friends
[Bridge]
Go M
Go A
Go S and S and O
Go C and H and E and I
Go C
Go H and E and I
Go M, A double K
Go A and K and O, K, O
Spell it
M-A-S-S-O-C-H-E-I
Massocheichei
Doesn't sound right to me
Makkakoko
That's way too many K's
It should be mass - achoose
Like the "mass" in "massproduce" but without "produce"
Massachusetts
That's the state I'm talking about
Massachusetts
Yeah, come on down, and you can see
It's the paradise on earth
[Chorus 3]
Yeah, Massachusetts
Paradise on earth
Boston city skyline or a picnic in the park
Checking out the nightlife and suddenly you're sucking on a cock
Massachusetts, greatest state of all
Just because you're kissin' a man doesn't make you gay
Confused
1620 - the pilgrims came to town
Mayflower
Sometimes I watch The Lion King and I cry when Mufasa dies
Prudential Tower
City Hall and a lighthouse by the bay
Who hasn't ever seen a hunk on the bus and thought "Mmm, I wanna sit on your lap"
Let me si-i-i-it
Massachusetts
