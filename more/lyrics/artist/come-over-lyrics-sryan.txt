[Verse 1: One Direction]
I know it's late, but you're on my mind
I'm wide awake, and I wanna stop by
So you can get up, and get out of the bed
Cause I wanna see you, and I been wondering....
Baby I wanna come see you, said I really wanna come see you
Don't you worry about a thing, I'm just wantin' to hold you
Embrace you, I want to guide you, tell you
How much I love you, I want you, I need you, I miss you
[Chorus: One Direction]
Baby, Baby, Baby can you get up tonight
because I am having having having a party all night
Will you come over?
Let's have a lot of fun in the party
with the fun gang
Will you come over tonight?
Will you come over tonight?
(Come over tonight)
(Come over tonight)
(Come over tonight)
(Come over tonight)
Will you come over tonight baby?
[Verse 2: One Direction]
Stepped up in the club, where them chicks be at
You were standing at the bar, saw you from the back
Legs straight bangin and that ass is fat, (something) on your body girl, I fucks with that
I'm the type of cat, I know what I like
See you the type of lady I'll take home and wife, So won't you go grab your coat get your bag
I'll be in the parking lot chilling with the roof back
[Chorus: One Direction]
Baby, Baby, Baby can you get up tonight
because I am having having having a party all night
Will you come over?
Let's have a lot of fun in the party
with the fun gang
Will you come over tonight?
Will you come over tonight?
Baby, can you come cover tonight? tonight? tonight?
[Chorus: One Direction]
Baby, Baby, Baby can you get up tonight
because I am having having having a party all night
Will you come over?
Let's have a lot of fun in the party
with the fun gang
Will you come over tonight?
Will you come over tonight?
Baby, Baby, Baby can you get up tonight
because I am having having having a party all night
Will you come over?
Let's have a lot of fun in the party
with the fun gang
Will you come over tonight?
Will you come over tonight?
(Come over tonight)
(Come over tonight)
(Come over tonight)
(Come over tonight)
Will you come over tonight baby?
