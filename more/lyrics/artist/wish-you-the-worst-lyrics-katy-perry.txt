I saw you at the grocery store
Oh, you both looked happy
Picking out the usual
She's a carbon copy
Of everything you lost
Of everything I'm not
I guess you just forgot
How to pick 'em
If she's the one I've heard about
I'm disappointed
If she's the reason why you left
I'm not impressed at all
Well, this looks like the end
Yeah, we can still be friends
Congratulations
Let me be the first
To wish you the worst
'Cause I think you
Deserve each other
Let me the curse that creeps
Under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish
The was me again
And again
And again
And again
Well, someone had to tell the truth
And I'm always honest
I read you like an open book
And it's obvious to me
She's just the one between
Heading no where fast
Sure, it's gonna last forever
Let me be the first
To wish you the worst
'Cause I think you
Deserve each other
Let me the curse that creeps
Under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me
Let me be the first
To wish you the worst
'Cause I think you
Deserve each other
Let me the curse that creeps
Under your skin
Until your heart caves in
And you wish she was me again
And again
And again
And again
Oh, you wish
You wish
You wish
You do
