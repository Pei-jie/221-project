In real life
I'm waking up alone
It's one more night
You didn't make it home
And one more time
You won't pick up the phone
In real life
You never bring me flowers
When you're here
It's only for an hour
I'm getting used
To being on my own
Because in real life
You're not what I thought
Real life
This isn't what I want
Guess things aren't always what they seem
But in my dreams
I'm waking up to roses
Champagne kisses
I know it's
Always, always gonna be
Gonna be this way
In my dreams
You're standing right beside me
Two hearts
Finally colliding
Then I wake up
And realize, realize
This is real life
This is real life
Real life
In real life
It doesn't always work out
People fall
In love and then they fall out
Hearts can break
And never make a sound
Because in real life
You're not what I thought
Real life
This isn't what I want
Guess things aren't always what they seem
But in my dreams
I'm waking up to roses
Champagne kisses
I know it's
Always, always gonna be, gonna be this way
In my dreams
You're standing right beside me
Two hearts
Finally colliding
Then I wake up
And realize, realize
This is real life
Just when I thought this was all real life could be
Somebody came along and made my dream reality
And now in real life
I'm waking up to roses
Champagne kisses
I know it's
Always, always gonna be
Gonna be this way
In my dreams
He's standing right beside me
Two hearts
Finally colliding
When I wake up
I realize, realize
This is real life
