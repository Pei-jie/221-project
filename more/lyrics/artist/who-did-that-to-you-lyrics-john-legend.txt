Yeah, Now I am not afraid to do the Lord's work
You say vengeance is his but Imma do it first
I'm gonna handle my business in the name of the
Law, Ooooh
Now if he made you cry oh I gotta know
if he's not ready to die, he best prepare for it
My judgment's divine I'll tell you who you can call, you can call
You better call the police, call the coroner, call up your priest
Have them warn ya, won't be no peace, when I find that fool
Who did that to you, Yeah?
Who did that to you, My baby, Who did that to you
Gotta find that fool, who did that to you?
Now I dont take pleasure in a man's pain
But my wrath will come down, like a cold rain
And there won't be no shelter, no place you can go
Eeeeh, heeey, It's time to put your hands up, time for a surrender
I'm a vigilante, my loves defender
You're a wanted man, here everybody knows, yeeeah
You better call the police, call the coroner, call up your priest
Have them warn ya, won't be no peace, when I find that fool
Who did that to you, Yeah?
Who did that to you? My baby, Who did that to you?
Gotta find that fool, who did that to you?
He'll keep on running but, Im closing in
I'll hunt him down until the bitter end
If you see me coming then, who are you gonna call? Yeeah
You better call the police, call the coroner, call up your priest
Have them warn ya, won't be no peace, when I find that fool
You better call the doctor, call the lawyer
I'll chased him all the way to California
Get my hey yea, gonna find that fool
Who did that to you?
