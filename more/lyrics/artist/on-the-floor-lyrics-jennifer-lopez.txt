It's a new generation (Mr. Worldwide)
Of party people
Now, get on the floor
Dale, get on the floor (Red One)
Let me introduce you to my party people
In the club...
[Jennifer Lopez]
I'm loose
And everybody knows I get off the train
Baby it's the truth
I'm like inception I play with your brain
So I don't sleep I snooze
I don't play no games so don't get it confused no
Cos you will lose yeah
Now pump it up
And back it up like a Tonka truck
Dale!
[Jennifer Lopez]
If you go hard you gotta get on the floor
If you're a party freak then step on the floor
If you're an animal then tear up the floor
Break a sweat on the floor
Yeah we work on the floor
Don't stop keep it moving
Put your drinks up!
Pick your body up and drop it on the floor
Let the rhythm change your world on the floor
You know we're running sh*t tonight on the floor
Brazil Morocco
London to Ibiza
Straight to LA, New York
Vegas to Africa (Dale!)
[Chorus]
Dance the night away
Live your life ,and stay young on the floor...
Dance the night away
Grab someone and drink a little more..
Aaa la la la la, lalalalalala la laaaa!
Tonight we gonna be on the floor
Aaa la la la la, lalalalalala la laaaa
Tonight we gonna be on the floor
[Verse 2]
I know you got it clap your hands on the floor
And keep on rockin', rock it up on the floor
If you're a criminal kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor, on the floor
Don't stop keep it moving
Put your drinks up!
Its getting ill it's getting sick on the floor
We never quit, we never rest on the floor
If I ain't wrong we gonna die on the floor
Brazil , Morocco
London to Ibiza
Straight to LA, New York
Vegas to Africa (Dale!)
[Chorus]
Dance the night away
Live your life, and stay young on the floor...
Dance the night way
Grab someone and drink a little more...

Freak it off, kick it up
Raise the roof wreck the dancehall
Rip these walls light it up
Make some noise ohhh
[Jennifer Lopez]
That badonka donk is like a trunk full of bass on an old school Chevy
All I need is some vodka and some, coke
And watch, get donkey konged, if you're ready for things to get heavy
I get on the floor and act a fool if you let me
Don't believe me just vet me
My name ain't Keath but I see why you Sweat me
L.A. Miami New York
