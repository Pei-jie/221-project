Got your voice mail
can you call me at a hotel
There's something
that's weighing
heavy on my heart and heavy on my chest
I'm a long night
you're the morning
I annoy you
and you bore me
And it's hard enough to make it through the world that's already a mess
All in good time, we'll be just fine
Either way we need to be happy
Tell me is this thing on
How do we keep this new
how do I keep you into me, into me
Without faking it too
What do we have to try
When everything is too loose
'Cause it always is just me and you
But it's the hardest thing
The hardest thing to do
And I want you to want me
like the first time you saw me
I know it's 10 years on but in my head we're still young and dumb
It'd be so hard to let go
and replace you I still love you
I just wanna find the thing that made me think this was the one!
All in good time, we'll be just fine
Either way we need to be happy
(x3)
Tell me is this thing on
How do we keep this new
how do I keep you into me, into me
Without faking it too
What do we have to try
When everything is too loose
'Cause it always is just me and you
But it's the hardest thing
The hardest thing to do
