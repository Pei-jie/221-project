pop
Made of clay
Shoot me down
Ill ricochet to the ground
Words of paint
Draw me out
And fill me in with your mouth
And hold your tongue
And I know its over before its begun
I lost my way
So help me out
And lend your hand til I am found
My voice is mute
Not to be heard
So its up to you
For you to bring those words
I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time
This grief you give
It takes its toll
It dries my heart and drowns my soul
I am a tree
Whose branch you broke
The brittle wood has turned stones, oh
I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time
For the last time
For the last time
I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time
For the last time
For the last time
