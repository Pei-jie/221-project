rock
Im a puppet on a string
Tracy island, time-traveling diamond
Coulda shaped heartaches
Come to find ya fall in some velvet morning
Years too late
Shes a silver lining lone ranger riding
Through an open space
In my mind when shes not right there beside me
I go crazy cause here isnt where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I cant help myself,
All I wanna hear her say is Are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine?
I guess what Im trying to say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair were not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape lost track of time and space
Shes a silver lining climbing on my desire
And I go crazy cause here isnt where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I cant help myself,
All I wanna hear her say is Are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine?
And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case Im mistaken,
I just wanna hear you say you got me baby
Are you mine?
Shes a silver lining lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when shes not right there beside me
And I go crazy cause here isnt where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I cant help myself,
All I wanna hear her say is Are you mine?
Well are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine?
