Angels We Have Heard On High
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly swinging o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains. Gloria...
Chorus:
Gloria In Excelsius Deo
Shepherd why this jubilee
Why your joyous strains prolong
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?
