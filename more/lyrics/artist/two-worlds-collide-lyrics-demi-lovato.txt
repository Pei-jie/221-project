She was given the world
So much that she couldn't see
And she needed someone
To show her who she could be
And she tried to survive
Wearing her heart on her sleeve
But I needed you to believe
You had your dreams, I had mine
You had your fears, I was fine
It showed me what I couldn't find
When two different worlds collide
La da-da da-da!
She was scared of it all
Watching from far away
And she was given a role
Never knew just when to play
And she tried to survive
Living her life on her own
Always afraid of the throne
But you've given me strength to find hope!
You had your dreams, I had mine
You had your fears, I was fine
It showed me what I couldn't find
When two different worlds collide
She was scared, unprepared
And lost in the dark, falling apart
I can survive with you by my side
We're gonna be alright
(We're gonna be alright)
This is what happens when two worlds collide
You had your dreams, I had mine
You had your fears, I was fine
It showed me what I couldn't find
When two different worlds collide
La da-da da-da!
You had your dreams, I had mine
(You had your dreams, I had mine)
You had your fears, I was fine
It showed me what I couldn't find
When two different worlds collide
When two different worlds collide
