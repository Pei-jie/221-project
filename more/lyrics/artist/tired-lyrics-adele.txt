Adele
pop
Hold my hand
While you cut me down
It'd only just begun
But now it's over now
And youre in the heat of moments
With your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle
Watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes
You were smiling in the spotlight
Dancing with the night
When I fell off your mind
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of buying your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oi, I'm tired
Where'd you go
When you stayed behind
I looked up and inside down
And outside only to find
A double taking, punching heart ache
laughing at my smile
I get closer
You obviously prefer her
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of buying your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oi, I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of buying your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oi, I'm tired
I should have known
Never mind
Said your open arms
I couldn't help the leap
That tripped me back into them
Even though I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of buying your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oi, I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of buying your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oi, I'm tired
