First, I'll acknowledge
Our trust has been broken
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance
Never thought I'd see your face again
Learning life through trial and error
Tryna make it right
Make it right
Make it right
Make it right
This time i'll do you right
Missing your good intentions
Missing you from a distance
Hope you did the same
I know that I caused a problem
Know that I left you livid
Pushed you far away
Learned it don't pay to lie
Cause i don't wanna see you cry
Sayin nothin gets you nowhere fast
I'ma hold it back inside
But now that i'm back around ya
Nothin else really matters
Hope you feel the same
First, I'll acknowledge
Our trust has been broken
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance
Never thought I'd see your face again
Learning life through trial and error
Tryna make it right
Make it right
Make it right
Make it right
This time I'll do you right
I'm going through all the motions
Trying to find a reason
Why we ended that way
Nothing in life is perfect
We'll be changing like the seasons
That's what they used to say
I'm just going to sleep alone at night
I don't wanna close my eyes
Wanna give you all I have to give
No more holdin back this time
Now that I'm back around ya
Nothin around me matters
Hope you feel the same
First, I'll acknowledge
Our trust has been broken
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance
Never thought I'd see your face again
Learning life through trial and error
Tryna make it right.
Make it right (make it right, make it right)
Make it right (make it right, make it right)
Make it right (make it right, make it right)
This time i'll do you right
(I'ma do you right)
You know I'ma do you right (I'ma do you right)
You know I'ma do you right (I'ma do you right)
You know I'ma do you right (I'ma do you right)
I'ma do you right
You know I'ma do you right
