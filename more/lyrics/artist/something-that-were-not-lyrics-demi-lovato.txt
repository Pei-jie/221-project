I should've known when I got you alone
That you were way too into me to know
This isnt love boy, this ain't even close
But you always think we're something that were not
And now you call me every single night
I only answer cause Im too polite
We happened once, or maybe it was twice
Yeah you always make it hard for me to stop
But you always think we're something that were not
You wanna be more than just friends
I cant go through this again
Stop trying get inside my head
Dont wanna do more than hook up
It's getting stupid, cause I should've known but I forgot
That you think we're something that were not, hey!
I hear youre telling everyone you know
That Im the one like you cant let me go
And you just keep on blowing up my phone
Cause you never seem to know when you should stop
Don't introduce me to any of your friends
Delete my number, don't call me again
We had some fun, but now it's gonna end
But you always make it hard for me to stop
Now you always think were something that were not, hey
You wanna be more than just friends
I cant go through this again
Stop trying get inside my head
Don't wanna do more than hook up
Its getting stupid, cause I should've known but I forgot
That you think we're something that we're not, hey!
Something that we're not, hey!
You think we're something that we're not
Yeah, you think we're something that we're..
*Not gonna happen dude*
You wanna be more than just friends
I can't through this again
Stop trying get inside my head
Don't wanna do more than hook up
It's getting stupid, cause I should've known but I forgot
That you think we're something that we're not, hey!
You think we're something that we're not
Something that we're not
Stop playing
You think we're something that we're not
But you think we're something that we're not
