I, I want to save your
Want to save your heart tonight
He'll only break you
Leave you torn apart, oh
It's a quarter to three
Can't sleep at all
He's so overrated.
If you told me to jump, I'd take the fall
When he wouldn't take it
All that you want's under your nose (yeah)
You should open your eyes but they stay closed, closed
I, I wanna save your
Wanna save your heart tonight
He'll only break you
Leave you torn apart, oh
I can't be no superman
But for you I'd be superhuman
I, I want to save you
Save you, save you, tonight
Oh, now you're at home and he don't call
Cause he don't adore you
To him you are just another doll
And I tried to warn you
What you want, what you need has been right here (yeah)
I can see that you're holding back those tears, tears
I, I wanna save you
Wanna save your heart tonight
He'll only break you
Leave you torn apart, oh
I can't be no superman
But for you I'd be superhuman
I, I want to save you
Save you, save you, tonight
Up, up and away
I'll take you with me
Up, up and away
I'll take you with me
I, I wanna save you,
Wanna save your heart tonight.
He'll only break you,
Leave you torn apart, oh
I can't be no superman
But for you I'll be superhuman
I, I want to save you
Save you, save you, tonight
I wanna save you, save you, save you tonight
I wanna save you, save you, save you tonight
