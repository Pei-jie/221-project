She was given the world
So much that she couldn't see
And she needed someone to show her,
who she could be.
And she tried to survive
Wearing her heart on her sleeve
But I needed you to believe
You had your dreams, I had mine.
You had your fears, I was fine.
Show me what I couldn't find,
When two different worlds collide.
La dee da dee da
She was scared of it all, watching from far away.
She was given a role, never knew just when to play.
And she tried to survive
Living her life on her own
Always afraid of the thrown
But You've givin me strength to find home.
You had your dreams, I had mine.
You had your fears, I was fine.
Show me what I couldn't find,
When two different worlds collide.
She was scared,
unprepared
Lost in the dark.
Falling apart,
I can't survive.
With you by my side,
We're gonna be alright. (we're gonna be alright)
This is what happens when two worlds collide.
You had your dreams, I had mine.
You had your fears, I was fine.
Show me what I couldn't find,
When two different worlds collide.
La dee da dee da
You had your dreams, I had mine.
You had your fears, I was fine.
Showed me what I couldn't find,
When two different worlds collide.
When two different worlds collide.
