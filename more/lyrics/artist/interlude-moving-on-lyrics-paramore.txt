Paramore
rock
Let 'em have their time
Sit back and let 'em shine
Let 'em rise and rise
'Cause one day they're gonna fall
Let 'em soak in the sun
Sit back and let 'em have their fun
Let 'em spill their guts
'Cause one day they're gonna slip on em
Well I could be angry but you're not worth a fight
And besides, I'm moving on
I've counted to ten and I'm feeling alright
And besides, I'm moving on
Let 'em play their songs
Let 'em say whats right and wrong
Let 'em do their thing
'Cause it'll never be you and me
We got our own style
We got a way of living life
If they can't get down
Well, we don't need them around
Well I could be angry but you're not worth a fight
And besides, I'm moving on
I've counted to ten and I'm feeling alright
And besides, I'm moving
Yes, I'm moving
And besides, I'm moving on
