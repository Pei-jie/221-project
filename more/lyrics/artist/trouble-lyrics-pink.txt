No attorneys, to plead my case
No opiates, to send me into outer space
And my fingers are bejeweled
With diamonds and gold but that ain't
Gonna help me now
I'm trouble, yeah trouble now
I'm trouble y'all, I disturb my own town
I'm trouble, yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all, I got trouble in my town
You think you're right, but you were wrong
You tried to take me, but I knew all along
You can't take me for a ride
I'm not a fool now, so you better run and hide
I'm trouble, yeah trouble now
I'm trouble y'all, I got trouble my own town
I'm trouble, yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all, I got trouble in my town
If you see me comin' down the street
Then you know it's time to go
Hey you know it's time to go
And you know it's time to go
'Cause here comes trouble
No attorneys, to plead my case
No opiates, to send me into outer space
And my fingers are bejeweled
With diamonds and gold but that ain't
Gonna help me now
You think you're right, but you were wrong
You tried to take me, but I knew all along
You can't take me for a ride
Well I'm not a fool now, so you better run and hide
Mmm trouble, yeah trouble now
I'm trouble y'all, I disturb my town
I'm trouble, yea, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all, I got trouble in my town
So if you see me comin' down the street
Then you know it's time to go, go
Well I've got trouble, yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all, I got trouble in my town
I'm trouble, yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all, I got trouble in my town
I'm trouble, yeah trouble now
I'm trouble y'all, I got trouble in my town
I'm trouble, yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all, I got trouble in my town, yeah
I'm trouble in my town, yeah, yeah
I'm trouble in my town, yeah, yeah
