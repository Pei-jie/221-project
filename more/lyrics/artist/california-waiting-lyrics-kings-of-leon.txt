rock
Little Mona Lisa laying by my side
"Crimson and Clover" pullin' overtime
I feel too close to be losin' touch
By givin' in, what am I givin' up
Am I losin' way too much?
Hey, California waiting
Every little thing's gotta be just right
But say, while you're tryin' to save me
But can't I get back, my lonely life?
I'm goin' so fast that I can't slow down
It's hard to get up when you're spinnin' round and round
I'd give you the news but nothing is changed
I'd sing you a song but they blew it away
All wrapped up in this stupid ass game
Hey, California waiting
Every little thing's gotta be just right
But say, while you're tryin' to save me
But can't I get back, my lonely life?
Hey, California waiting

Hey, California waiting
Every little thing's gotta be just right
But say, while you're tryin' to save me
But can't I go back, my lonely life
Can't I get back, my lonely life?
Can't I get back?
Can't I get back?
Can't I get back?
