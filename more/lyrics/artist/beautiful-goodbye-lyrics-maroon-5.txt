I count the ways I let you down
On my fingers and toes but I'm runnin out
Clever words cant help me now
I grip you tight but you're slipping out
And I remember your eyes were so bright, when I first met you. So in love that night
And now I'm kissin your tears goodnight, and I can't take it
You're even perfect when you cry
Beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye)
Its drippin from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye)
Your beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye whoa)
Its drippin from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye)
Oh yeah
When did the rain become a storm, when did the clouds begin to form
Yeah we got knocked off course by a natural force and we'll, we'll be swimmin when its gone
And I remember your eyes were so bright, when I first met you. So in love that night
And now I'm kissin your tears goodnight, and I cant take it
You're even perfect when you cry
Beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye)
Its drippin from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye)
Your beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye)
Its drippin from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye)
Oh yeah
All the pain you try to hide shows through your mascara lines as they stream down from your eyes
Let em go, let em fly, holding back wont turn back time, believe me I've tried
And your eyes were so bright, I remember your eyes were so bright
I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you how in love were we that night
And now I'm kissin your tears goodnight, and I cant take it
You're even perfect when you cry
Beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye)
Its drippin from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye)
Your beautiful goodbye (bye bye, bye bye whoa)
Its drippin from your eyes (bye bye, bye bye)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
