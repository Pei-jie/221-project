When there is love, I can't wait to talk about it
When things get rough, I'd like to walk with you
When it's night, I like to be the light thats missing
And remind you every minute of the future isn't written
Not yet
When there is love,
When the heart feels heavy we can lighten it up
If you've had enough
Well you can empty your glass and we can fill it back up
You know its up to us to make it all up, so what you making up?
I can make it up
That you could be loved no matter what
You know the only time is right now
Its right well where you are
You don't need a vacation when theres nothing to escape from
Sing it!
Ah la la la la,
Ah la la la la,
Lets all sing!
Ah la la la la, Lay me down
Everything is sound
Lets sing to be happy,
To feel things,
To communicate and be heard
We sing out to protest,
And to project
And to harmonize with birds
Whether its your birthday or your dying day its a celebration to rejoice!
To use your voice
And give wings
To any old choice
Whatever you're choosing right now,
Is right well, where you are,
You don't need a vacation when theres nothing to escape from
Set your vibration, and undulation to the highest it can go
And trust me, hear me, if it makes you want to sing,
Just sing it!
Ah la la la la,
Ah la la la la,
Lets all sing!
Ah la la la la, Lay me down
Everything is sound
Ah la la la la,
Ah la la la la,
Lets all sing!
Ah la la la la Hallelujah
Its a song that I've forgotten often
It doesnt make me wrong coz we all need the darkness... to see the light,
In our own eyes
Come on! Lets sing it
Ah la la la la,
Ah la la la la,
Lets all sing!
Ah la la la la, Lay me down
Everything is sound
Ah la la la la,
Ah la la la la,
Lets all sing!
Ah la la la la Hallelujah
We're connected now!
Ah la la la la,
Ah la la la la,
Lets all sing!
Hallelujah
Everything is sound
Ah la la la la,
Ah la la la la,
Lets all sing!
Hallelujah
We're connected now
