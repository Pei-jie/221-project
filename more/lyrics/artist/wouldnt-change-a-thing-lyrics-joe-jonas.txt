rock
It's like he doesn't hear a word I say
His mind is somewhere far away
And I don't know how to get there
It's like all he wants is to chill out
(She's serious)
He makes me wanna pull all my hair out
(She's always in a rush and interrupted)
Like he doesn't even care
(Like she doesn't even care)
You, me
We're face to face
But we don't see eye to eye
Like fire and rain
(Like fire and rain)
You can drive me insane
(You can drive me insane)
But I can't stay mad at you for anything
We're Venus and Mars
(Venus and Mars)
We're like different stars
(Like different stars)
You're the harmony to every song I sing
And I wouldn't change a thing
She's always trying to save the day
Just wanna let my music play
She's all or nothing
But my feeling's never change
Why does he try to read my mind?
(I try to read her mind)
It's not good to psychoanalyze
(She tries to pick a fight to get attention)
That's what all of my friends say
(That's what all of my friends say)
You, me
We're face to face
But we don't see eye to eye
Like fire and rain
(Like fire and rain)
You can drive me insane
(You can drive me insane)
But I can't stay mad at you for anything
We're Venus and Mars
(Venus and Mars)
We're like different stars
(Like different stars)
But you're the harmony to every song I sing
And I wouldn't change a thing
When I'm yes, she's no
When I hold on, he just lets go
We're perfectly imperfect
But I wouldn't change a thing, no
Like fire and rain
(Like fire and rain)
You can drive me insane
(You can drive me insane)
But I can't stay mad at you for anything
We're Venus and Mars
(Venus and Mars)
We're like different stars
(Like different stars)
But you're the harmony to every song I sing
And I wouldn't change a thing
But I can't stay mad at you for anything
We're Venus and Mars
(Venus and Mars)
We're like different stars
(Like different stars)
But you're the harmony to every song I sing
And I wouldn't change a, wouldn't change a thing
