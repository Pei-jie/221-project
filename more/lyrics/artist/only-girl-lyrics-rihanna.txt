I want you to love me, like I'm a hot ride
Be thinkin' of me, doin' what you like
So boy forget about the world cause it's gon' be me and you tonight
I'm gonna make your bed for ya, then imma make you swallow your pride

Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world...
