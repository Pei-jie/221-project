Last Friday night I was shocked
I thought the world revolved around me
Every time we are together
But I'm still looking forward
To a guy with more potential
Just admit we're together
We went out last Friday night
We went out last Friday night
We went out last Friday night
We went out last Friday night
I feel like you're crazy
But I'm still looking for love
You think that I'm crazy
But I'm still looking for love
Hey, we went out last Friday night
We went out last Friday night
We went out last Friday night
We went out last Friday night
I remember what happened on our date
Come on, come on, baby, you know what to say
Come on, girl, give me one more chance
One more chance at true romance
Come on, tell me how you feel
Come on, baby, come on, baby, let me heal
Just don't know what we should do
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, you
We went out last Friday night
We went out last Friday night
We went out last Friday night
We went out last Friday night
We went out last Friday night
We went out last Friday night
We went out last Friday night
We went out last Friday night
Last Friday night
