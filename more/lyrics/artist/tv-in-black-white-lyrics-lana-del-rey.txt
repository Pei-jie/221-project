If you get lonely think of me only
Prison isn't going to keep me from you
Remember Coney Island and how we'd
Wade into the water 'til the waves turned blue
Nobody does have to know
That our lives alive
Keep it on down low
If you want to hide
Got that same address
If you want to write
One Greenwich Avenue
Wishin' and thinkin' of you
Living without you is like TV in black and white
You turn me on and rock brought into my life
When I'm around you suddenly I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes
If you get lonely think of this only
Heaven hasn't forgotten the value
Though you can't hold me
Pick up and phone me
Use your one phone call on your ex girl boo
I won't tell a single soul
How you spend your nights
In your single cell
Holding your pillow tight
If you really are afraid
Then you ought to know
That you're the one I want the one I want
Forever more
Living without you is like TV in black and white
You turn me on and rock color into my life
When I'm around you suddenly I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes
I know you get scared sometimes boy
Nothing to be feared when you're in my heart
Troubles come in threes but in your case
They came in millions and trillions but that's alright
Living without you is like TV in black and white
You turn me on and rock color into my life
When I'm around you suddenly I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes
Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white
