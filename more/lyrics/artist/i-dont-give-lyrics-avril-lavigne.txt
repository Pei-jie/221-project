Every time you go away
It actually kinda makes my day
Every time you leave
You slam the door
You pick your words so carefully
You hate to think you're hurting me
You leave me laughing on
The floor
Cause I don't give it up, I don't give a damn
What you say about that
You know I don't give it up, I don't give a damn
What you say about that
You know I'm not gonna cry, about some stupid guy
A guy who thinks he's all that
I thought we were just hanging out
So why'd you kiss me on the mouth
You thought the way you taste
Would get me high
You went to all your friends to brag
Guys are always such a drag
Don't you know the reason that I kissed you was to
Say goodbye
Cause I don't give it up
I don't give a damn what you say about that
You know I don't give it up
I don't give a damn what you say about that
You know I'm not gonna cry about some stupid guy
A guy who thinks he's all that
Hanging hanging out, I am simply
Hanging hanging out, I am simply
Hanging so why'd you kiss me on the mouth?
Don't you know that I
I don't give a damn about you
I won't give it up not for you
I don't give a damn about you
I won't give it up not for you
I'm not gonna cry about some stupid guy
A guy who thinks he's all that
I don't give it up
I don't give a damn what you say about that
You know I don't give it up
I don't give a damn what you say about that
I don't give it up
I don't give a damn what you say about that
You know I don't give it up
I don't give a damn what you say about that
