Brian McKnight:
Love wandered inside, stronger than you, stronger than I
Mariah Carey:
And now, that its begun, we cannot turn back
Brian McKnight:
We can only turn in to one
Both:
I won't ever be too, far away to feel you, and I won't hesitate at all, whenever you call, and I'll always remember, that part of you, so tender, I'll be the one to catch your fall, whenever you call
Mariah:
And I'm, truly inspired, finding my soul, there in your eyes, and you have opened my heart, and lifted me inside, by showing me yourself undisguised
Both:
And I won't ever be too, far away to feel you, and I won't hesitate at all, whenever you call, and I'll always remember that part of you so tender, I'll be the one to catch your fall, whenever you call
Brian:
And I will breathe for you each day, comfort you through all the pain, gently kiss your fears away
Mariah:
You can turn to me and cry, always understand that I give you all I have inside
And I won't ever be too, far away to feel you
Brain:
And I won't hesitate at all
Mariah:
Whenever you call
Both:
I won't ever be too far to feel you, and I won't hesitate at all whenever you call, I'll always remember that part of you so tender and be the one to catch your fall whenever you call
Mariah:
Yeah Yeah, oh whenever you call
