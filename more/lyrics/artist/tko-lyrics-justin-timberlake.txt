[Intro: Timbaland]
In all, enthrilling new, living sound
Kill me with that coo-coochie-coochie-coo
She kill me with that coo-coochie-coochie-coo
She kill me with that coo-coochie-coochie-coo
She kill me with that coo-coochie-coochie-coo
She kill me with that coo-coochie-coochie-coo
She kill me with that coo-coochie-coochie-coo
She kill me with that coo-coochie-coochie-coo
Lights out, TKO
[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, everyday in training to get the gold
That's why your body's crazy
But you can't run from yourself, that's where it's difficult,
Girl I can see in your eyes that there's something inside that made you evil
Where did you go, cause it just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you say
Don't know why it gets to me
[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
The cut's right on my heart, yeah it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?
[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I don't understand it
Tell me how could you be so low
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Trying to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome,
Dammit babe
This ain't the girl I used to know
No, not anymore, TKO
[Bridge 2: Justin Timberlake]
I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
It's just a TKO
I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
T-TKO
Out for the count
Girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
Now, I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, now I don't really know what we're fighting for
This rematch sex is amazing
But nobody wins if somebody's heart is swole
Cause when I see you move like you got something inside that made you lethal
Where did you go, it just ain't fair
Over here thinking bout the shit you do
Don't know what I got to lose
[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
The cut's right on my heart, yeah it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?
[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I don't understand it
Tell me how could you be so low, yeah
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Trying to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome,
Dammit babe
This ain't the girl I used to know
No, not anymore, TKO
[Bridge 2: Justin Timberlake]
I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
It's just a TKO
I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
