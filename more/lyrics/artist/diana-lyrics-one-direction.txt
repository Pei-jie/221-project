Diana
Front pages, all your pictures
Been making it look so small
How could someone not miss you at all
Woah oh oh
I never would mistreat ya
Oh I'm not a criminal
I could speak a different language
But I still hear your call
Diana
Let me be the one too
Light a fire inside those eyes
You can own me
You don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana
Let me be the one too
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize
Baby you'd be saving mine
oh ooh
Dianaâ€¨I
t's only been four months but
You've fallen down so far
How could someone mislead you at all
Woah oh ooh
I wanna reach out for ya
I wanna break these walls
I speak a different language
But I still hear you call
Diana
Let me be the one too
Light a fire inside those eyes
You could own me
You don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana
Let me be the one too
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize
Baby you'd be saving mine
We all need something
This can't be over now
If I could hold ya
I swear I'd never
Put you down
Diana
Let me be the one too
Light a fire inside those eyes
You can own me
You don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana
Let me be the one too
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize
Baby you'd be saving mine
Oh oh oh
Diana
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohh
Diana
Baby you'd be saving mine
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohh
Diana
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohh
Diana
Baby you'd be saving mine
