rock
Man it's been a long day
Stuck thinking 'bout it
Driving on the freeway
Wonderin' if I really
Tried everything I could
Not knowing if I should
Try a little a harder
Oh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be
Another one like this
And I confess
That I'm only holding on
By a thin, thin thread
Im kickin' the curb
cause you never heard
the words that you needed so bad
and Im kickin the dirt cause I never gave you
the things that you needed to have
Im so sad, sad
Man it's been a long night
Just sittin' here
Trying not to look back
Still looking at the
Road we never drove on
And wonderin' if the one
I chose was the right one
Oh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be
Another one like this
And I confess
That I'm only holding on
By a thin, thin thread
Im kickin' the curb
cause you never heard
the words that you needed so bad
and Im kickin' the dirt cause I never gave you
the things that you needed to have
Im so sad, sad
So sad, so sad
Oh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be
Another one like this
And I confess
That I'm only holding on
By a thin, thin thread
Im kickin' the curb
cause you never heard
the words that you needed so bad
and Im kickin' the dirt cause I never gave you
the things that you needed to have
And Im kickin' the curb
cause you never heard
the words that you needed so bad
I'm so sad, so sad
