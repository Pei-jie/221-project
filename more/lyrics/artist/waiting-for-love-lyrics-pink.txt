Pink
pop
She looks to the sun
Help her to carry on
Breaking down all the years
Wondering how she got here
She drifts through the sky
Counting the reasons why
How my life turned so fast
Remembering all of the past
All the changes, and all the mistakes
Foolishly laughing at things that
Words that she says
She looks to the stars
Breaking, time to follow the heart
Her world is falling apart
And the turning of every new page
A book on a shelf that is there to remain
Breaking the walls as she's tearing them down
A she is starting to drown
She's waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting so long
She prays to the gods
Telling how she needs someone
Help me find where I am today
Life is looking very grey
All the changes and all the mistakes
Foolishly laughing at things that
Everything that she says
Waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
I'm waiting for a new day to rise
Conversations to make sense to me and my mind
I need someone to lift me right off of my feet
And I want it, and I need it, and I'll leave it all behind
And all the changes I've made
And I remember the words
That you'll never say
Waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting for love
She's waiting for love
She's waiting for love
Waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting for love
She's waiting, waiting so long
Ohh ohh yeah
Ohh ohh yeah yeah
She's waiting, waiting for love
She looks to the sun
