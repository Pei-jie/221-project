Ah ah youre beautiful
Ah ah youre beautiful
Hop on, the back of my bike
Let the good the wind blow through your hair
With a ass like that, and a smile so bright
Oh youre killing me, you know it aint fair
(yeah)
Ride on, through the middle of the night
Let moonlight kiss your skin
When you dance like that, your jeans so tight
Oh youre killing me, baby do it again
(yeah)
You're beautiful, and your mind is fucking beautiful
And I cant pretend but that doesnt mean a thing to me, to me, yeah
You're beautiful, good lord, youre fucking beautiful
And I cant pretend that that doesnt mean a thing to me, to me, yeah
I like when you run red lights, dont stop till you thrill me, oh how you thrill me
Always in control, how you do it I dont know
But I dont care, take me anywhere,
Cause its beautiful, ooh you make me feel invincible
And I cant pretend that that doesnt mean a thing to me, to me, ohh yeah
You're beautiful, and your mind is fucking beautiful
And I cant pretend that that doesnt mean a thing to me, to me, yeah
You're beautiful, good lord, youre fucking beautiful
And I cant pretend that that doesnt mean a thing to me, to me, yeah, yeah
Ah ah youre beautiful
Ah ah youre beautiful
You dont know what youre doing darling
Hop on back my bike darling
Dont you worry darling
