So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry
Forgive me, first love, but Im tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why
Dont get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes
Its bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, its tiring
This love has dried up, and stay behind
And if I stay Ill be a lie
Then choke on words Id always hide
Excuse me, first love, but were through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new
Forgive me, first love, but Im too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love, forgive me
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love
