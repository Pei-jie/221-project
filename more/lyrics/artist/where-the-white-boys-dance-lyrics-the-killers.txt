rock
Take me to the place where the white boys dance
Take me to the place where they run and play
My baby is gone, you might have a chance
Just take me to the place where the white boys dance
They hug in silence as the sun sets
On their empty street
Her suspicions, well theyre rising high
And the man who sweeps him off she doesnt meet
She walks inside and pours a strong one
To put her mind at ease
Its the calm before another storm
Her brain shifts from the whiskey to the keys
Take me to the place where the white boys dance
Take me to the place where they run and play
My baby is gone, you might have a chance
Just take me to the place where the white boys dance
Her heart is racing, she phones a friend and says
Im in an awful place
That fools been messing 'round on me
Ive seen it in his eyes and on his face"
Hold on a minute, youre talking crazy
Dont be that jealous, girl
Just tell Levon you need an hour or two
'Cause were gonna go and change somebodys world
Take me to the place where the white boys dance
Take me to the place where they run and play
My baby is gone, you might have a chance
Just take me to the place where the white boys dance
Its the calm before another storm
Its the calm before another storm
Her brain shifts from the whiskey to the keys
Take me to the place where the white boys dance
Take me to the place where they run and play
My baby is gone, you might have a chance
Just take me to the place where the white boys dance
