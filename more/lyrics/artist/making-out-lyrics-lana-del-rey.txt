Hiya, honey, what ya doing?
I've been hula-hooping waiting for you, aah...
Whoa, hater, fakers, mass manipulators,
don't know what you're trying to prove...
I'm the New York City queen queen,
you should hear me sing sing,
baby, I'm the real thing, check, one, two...
Stop looking at my trainwreck life and start listening to the way I sing the blues...
You know, I know what they say about me,
I know that they think I'm danger,
so what if it makes me happy, happy, happy?
It doesn't really matter what you say!
Cause I ain't gonna quit till the day I die,
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots,
making out in parking lots with any little boy I spot,
baby, you can't stop me, stop me, no.
When I'm hot, I'm hot...
Hiya, honey, how's it going?
Saw you skipping rope on TV, looking blue, aah...
You're shakin' , makin' music and you're famous.
Deep down you're the same girl I knew.
She said ''I know what they say about you, I know that they think you're crazy, I know that they are mistaking, baby, baby''...
It doesn't really matter what they say!
Cause I ain't gonna quit till the day I die,
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots,
making out in parking lots with any little boy I spot,
baby, you can't stop me, stop me, now...
When I'm hot, I'm hot...
Singing for the gangsters,
chasing all that paper,
living life so dangerously,
and there' s nothing for my anger,
money is my savior,
I can be whatever I think...
It's like heaven, heaven,
living on the edge,
never knowing where I'm going to be.
And I'm dreading ever settling down,
That's when dying is beginning to gleam...
I doesn't really matter what you say!
Cause I ain't gonna change till the day I die,
I'll be taking drug, doing shots,
making out in parking lots with any little boy I spot,
honey, you can't stop me, stop me, now...
When I'm hot, I'm hot, hot...
