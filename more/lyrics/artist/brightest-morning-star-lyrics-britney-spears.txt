[Verse 1]
You are the light of my beautiful life
You are the light of my beautiful life
You know I wake up
And every day I feel safe
Knowing that you got my back now and forever
Living my life, 'cause I've got loving to do
When a tear falls, you put your hands up
You catch my tears, and I'm feelling so close
To your love now, If I was lost I light the room
I lift my hands and pray cause life gets tough some days
But I will not loose faith, cause you will lead the way
[Chorus]
You're my light when it gets dark
You're always in my heart
You're my Brightest Morning Star
You're my light when it gets dark
You're always in my heart
You're my Brightest Morning Star
[Verse 2]
You are the light of my beautiful life
I could never let go
You're my Brightest Morning Star
You are the light of my beautiful life
I could never let go
You're my Brightest Morning Star
In your arms, I feel alive
I am not afraid, I would keep you
Listen closely, look for signs everyday
I lift my hands and pray cause life gets tough some days
But I will not loose faith, cause you will lead the way
[Chorus]
You're my light when it gets dark
You're always in my heart
You're my Brightest Morning Star
You're my light when it gets dark
You're always in my heart
You're my Brightest Morning Star
You're my light when it gets dark
You're always in my heart
You're my Brightest Morning Star
You're my light when it gets dark
You're always in my heart
You're my Brightest Morning Star
You are the light of my beautiful life
You are the light of my beautiful life
