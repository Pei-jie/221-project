(LIAM)
People say we shouldnt be together
Too young to know about forever
But I say they dont know what they're talk talk talkin about
(HARRY)
Cause this love is only getting stronger
So I dont wanna wait any longer
I just wanna tell the world that you're mine girl
Ohh
(ZAYN)
They dont know about the things we do
They dont know about the I love you's
But I bet you if they only knew
They would just be jealous of us
They dont know about the up all nights
They dont know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby they dont know about
They dont know about us
(NIALL)
Just one touch and I was a believer
Every kiss it gets a little sweeter
(HARRY)
Its getting better
Keeps getting better all the time girl

They dont know about the things we do
They dont know about the I love you's
But I bet you if they only knew

Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby they dont know about
They dont know about us
(LOUIS)
They dont know how special you are
They dont know what you've done to my heart
They can't say anything they want
Cause they dont know 'bout us
