rock
The smiles as she walked in the room
Have all turned into frowns
Am I too quick to assume
The love is no longer in bloom?
The tantrums and the tears
Play a very different tune
To what they did before, her heads red raw
And the ending doesn't sound
The happiest around
When you sobbed before it felt much more
Like the product of a squabble
Now there's reason for it to be something more
And there would be, oh, it's uncertain
Whether the curtain has shut for good
She says, "See if it's still raining
I'm not dressed for it and if you loved me"
Well, I interrupt to receive the scowl and stare
But still decided to stop her there
Would it be outrageous to say
We're either shouting or we're shagging?
Docked in tempestuous bays
At least that's how we felt yesterday
The eyes are getting heavier
And whether you're asleep or awake is a mystery
Would a kiss be too much to ask?
When you fit me as Sunday's frozen pitch
Fits the thermos flask
It's a pity, it just hit me, we can't go back
To the chest touching on the back
