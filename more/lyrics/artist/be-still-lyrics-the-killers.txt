rock
Be still and go on to bed,
Nobody knows what lies ahead,
And life is short to say the least,
We're in the belly of the beast,
Be still,
Wild and young,
Long may your innocence reign,
Like shells on the shore,
And may your limits be unknown,
May your efforts be your own,
If you ever feel you can't take it anymore,
Don't break character,
You've got a lot of heart,
Is this real or just a dream?
Rise up like the sun,
Labor 'till the work is done,
Be still,
One day you'll leave,
Fearlessness on your sleeves,
When you come back,
Tell me what did you see?
(What did you see?)
Was there something out there for me?
Be still,
Close your eyes,
Soon enough you'll be on your own,
Steady and straight,
And if they drag you through the mud,
It doesn't change whats in your blood,
(Over chains)
Over chains,
When they knock you down,
Don't break character,
You've got a lot of heart,
Is this real or just a dream,
Be still,
Be still,
Be still,
Be still,
Over rock and chain,
Over sunset plain,
Over trap and snare,
When you're in too deep,
In your wildness dream,
In your made up schemes,
When they knock you down,
When they knock you down,
Don't break character,
You've got so much heart,
Is this real or just a dream.
Oh rise up like the sun and labor till the work is done,
Rise up like the sun and labor till the work is,
Rise up like the sun and labor till the work is done.
