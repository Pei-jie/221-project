Love wandered inside
Stronger than you
Stronger than I
And now that it has begun
We cannot turn back
We can only turn into one
I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all whenever you call
And I'll always remember the part of you so tender
I'll be the one to catch your fall whenever you call
And I'm truly inspired finding my soul there in your eyes
And you have opened my heart and lifted me inside
By showing me yourself undisguised
I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all whenever you call
And I'll always remember the part of you so tender
I'll be the one to catch your fall whenever you call
And I will breathe for you each day, comfort you through all the pain
Gently kiss your fears away
You can turn to me and cry, always understand that I
Give you all I am inside
And I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all whenever you call
I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all whenever you call
And I'll always remember the part of you so tender
And be the one to catch your fall whenever you call
Whenever you call
