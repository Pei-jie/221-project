Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with her test tube
Oh, oh oh oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
"Can I take you out to the pictures Joan?"
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead
Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times, "I must not be so
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead
P.C. Thirty One said, "We caught a dirty one"
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures
Oh, oh oh oh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free
The judge does not agree, and he tells them so
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead
Silver hammer man!
