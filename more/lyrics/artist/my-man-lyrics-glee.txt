Oh, my man, I love him so, he'll never know
All my life is just despair, but I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say I'll go away
When I know I'll come back on my knees someday
For whatever my man is
I am his forevermore
Oh, my man, I love him so, he'll never know
All my life is just despair, but I don't care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright, all right
What's the difference if I say I'll go away
When I know I'll come back on my knees someday
For whatever my man is
I am his forevermore
