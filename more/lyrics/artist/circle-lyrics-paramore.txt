Paramore
rock
Take this time to realize
That you always shut your eyes
In the midst of a trial
And everything is always right
And I think that it's time
This battle must be won
But you pushed it aside
Pushed it aside, pretend that it's gone
This circle never ends
And it's time you
Just face it, don't pretend
That it's over
This circle never ends
And it's time you
Just face it, don't pretend
That it's over
Take this time to realize
That you always force a smile
In the midst of a trial
And everything is always right
And I think that it's time
This battle must be won
But you pushed it aside
Pushed it aside, pretend that it's gone
This circle never ends
And it's time you
Just face it, don't pretend
That it's over
This circle never ends
And it's time you
Just face it, don't pretend
That it's over
And it never ends
It never ends
And it never ends
No, it never ends
This circle never ends
And it's time you
Just face it, don't pretend
That it's over
This circle never ends
And it's time you
Just face it, don't pretend
That it's over, it's over
