I was sitting all alone yeah
A lot on my mind
Felt a tap on my shoulder
Out goes my eyes
I wasn't in the mood for another man
Telling me lies
How can a girl say no when you flash that sexy smile
And you say
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
Baby I don't mind
Love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type (Boy you're just so nasty)
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
Baby, I don't mind
Love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type
In the middle of the floor now
I just don't care
See my body so low now
While stop instead
Let 'em take what they want but I'm feelin' it
And it's for you baby
Tell me how can a girl say no when you calling out your name
And you say
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
Baby I don't mind
Love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type (Boy you're just so nasty)
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
Baby, I don't mind
Love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type
What's your fantasy? (Ooh nasty nasty)
Tell them all to me (Ooh nasty nasty)
Don't you be afraid (Ooh nasty nasty)
Share your nasty secret baby hey
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
Baby I don't mind
Love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my type (Boy you're just so nasty)
N-A-S-T-Y, you're nasty
Baby, I don't mind
Love the way you're talking nasty
You know you just my typy
