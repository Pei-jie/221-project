Today I'm not myself
And you, you're someone else
And all these rules don't fit
And all that starts can quit
What a peculiar state we're in
What a peculiar state we're in
Let's play the game
Where all of the life we lead can change
Let's play the game
Where nothing that we can see, the same
We'll find other pieces to the puzzles
Slipping out under the locks
I could show you how many moves to checkmate, right now
We could take apart this life we're building
And pack it up inside a box
All that really matters is we're doing it, right now
Right now
(Instrumental)
