[LIAM PAYNE:]
It feels like we've been living in fast-foward
Another moment passing by (U-up all night)
The party's ending but it's now or never
Nobody's going home tonight (U-up all night)
[HARRY STYLES:]
Katy Perry's on replay, she's on replay
DJ got the floor to shake, the floor to shake
People going all the way, yeah all the way
I'm still wide awake
[EVERYONE:]
I wanna stay up all night
And jump around until we see the sun
I wanna stay up all night
And find a girl and tell her she's the one
Hold on to the feeling
And don't let it go
Cause we got the floor now
Get out of control
I wanna stay up all night
And do it all with you
[EVERYONE:]
Up all night
Like this, all night (hey)
Up all night
Like this, all night (hey)
Up all night
[ZAYN MALIK:]
Don't even care about the table breaking
We only wanna have a laugh (U-up all night)
I'm only thinking 'bout this girl I'm seeing
I hope she'll wanna kiss me back (U-up all night)
