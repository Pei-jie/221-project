Hey, is this thing on? (uh uh)
I saw him dancing near a record machine
I knew he must have been about 17
The beat was going strong
Playin my favorite song
I could tell it wouldn't be long till he was with
Me (yeah me)
I could tell it wouldn't be long till he was with
Me (yeah with me)
singing...
I love rock and roll, so put another dime in the
Jukebox baby
I love rock and roll so come and take the time and
Dance with me
Oh!
He smiled so I got up and asked for his name
But that don't matter he said, 'cause it's all the same.
He said, can I take you home?
Where we can be alone
And next we're moving on, and he was with me (yeah

We were moving on, and singing that same ol' song
