People, oh, people
There are mountains in our way
We got brother against brother
How will we stand on judgement day?
Oh people, oh, people
We gotta find a better way
If we keep fighting, if we keep dividing
Now, tell me where will the children play?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
People, oh, people
Hear every word I say
We come in all different colors
No one's above the other
We are all the same
People, oh people
Let's put hatred to an end
In our hearts we have the answer
In our souls we have the power
Together we can make a change
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
People
Can't you see the walls tumbling down?
People
Can't you feel the chains breaking down?
A revolution is going down
A revolution is going down
Can't you feel these walls tumbling down, down, down?
Can't you feel the chains are breaking down?
Oh people, can you feel it? The walls are tumbling down
Can't you feel it? Can't you feel it? These chains are breaking down
Gotta come together, my brothers and sisters
People, let's do it now, now
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
Can't you feel the change?
It's a revolution
