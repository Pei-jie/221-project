There's a wild wind blowing down the corner of my street
Every night there the headlights are glowing
There's a cold war coming on the radio, I heard
Baby, it's a violent world
Oh love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow?
I could hear rain coming, I could hear the siren sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Time came a-creeping, oh, and time's a loaded gun
Every road is a ray of light
It goes on, time only can lead you on
Still, it's such a beautiful night
Oh love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow?
I can hear rain coming like a serenade of sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Gravity, release me
And don't ever hold me down
Now my feet won't touch the ground
