I used to think, I had the answers to everything
But now I know that life doesn't always go my way, yeah
Feels like I'm caught in the middle
That's when I realize
I'm not a girl, not yet a woman
All I need is time, a moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl
There is no need to protect me
It's time that I learn to face up to this on my own
I've seen so much more than you know now
So don't tell me to shut my eyes
I'm not a girl, not yet a woman
All I need is time, a moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl
But if you look at me closely
You will see it in my eyes
This girl will always find her way
I'm not a girl, don't tell me what to believe
Not yet a woman
I'm just trying to find the woman in me, yeah
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl, not yet a woman, no no
All I need is time, a moment that is mine
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl
Ooh, not yet a woman
