Eenie, meenie, minie, mo

[Rihanna]
Ladies don't worry cause they got plenty mo'
They be falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Oh its raining men girl what you worried 'bout
Who you think you getting with that "Hi, let me freak ya."?
You got me mistaken thinkin' you gon' get it easy
First of all you need to know that I'm not the one
Think you gettin' somethin' baby, you aint gettin' none
All you need to know that I'm a 2 times 5
Load it, cock it, aim it baby, boom bye bye
Set your standards lower, boy you're aimin' too high
Matter of fact your friend looks better so, (huh) good bye

Excuse me but who are you fixin' to be
Let them muthafuckas know its plenty fish in the sea
And he sweatin' me just cause I got the tightest hole
But I couldn't find that th-thing wit a microscope
Give me dome, dome, d-d-d-d-d dome, dome, dome
I ain't trippin on yo money, money long, long, long
Want my own tv production company
So tell Harpo to hit me Celie
Anyway RiRi what rhymes with yo name freely
Money got you vacationing in Chile
do you want to sit on the back while i wheelie really? really!?
No for real, really?
Laid out on the beach they be feedin me my catfishes
Cause it's raining men

Ridin' big, living good, doing big things
Dancing don't pay, player keep the money, I can buy my own drink
Up in the club, see man coming by a dozen so it don't mean nothing to me
And I aint even worry 'bout you homie, cause' there's plenty more fish in the sea
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo
Catch a playa by the toe
