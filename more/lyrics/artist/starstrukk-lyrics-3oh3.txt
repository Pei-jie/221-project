Nice legs, Daisy Dukes makes a man go
That's the way they all come through like
Low cut, see through shirts that make ya
That's the way she come through like
'Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down
'Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down
I think I should know
How to make love to something innocent
Without leaving my fingerprints out
Now, L O V E is just another word
I never learned to pronounce
How do I say I'm sorry
'Cause the word is just never gonna come out
Now, L O V E is just another word
I never learned to pronounce
Tight jeans, double D's makin' me go
All the people on the street know
Iced out, lit up make the kids go
All the people on the street know
'Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down
'Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down
I think I should know
How to make love to something innocent
Without leaving my fingerprints out
Now, L O V E is just another word
I never learned to pronounce
How do I say I'm sorry
'Cause the word is just never gonna come out
Now, L O V E is just another word
I never learned to pronounce
You know that type of sh***
Just don't work on me
Listen, no trying to flirt with me
Don't take this personally
Cuz we were never in love
It doesn't really matter who you say you are
Singing out the window of your car
Find another girl across the bar
Cuz L-O-V-E's not what this was
I think I should know
How to make love to something innocent
Without leaving my fingerprints out
Now, L O V E is just another word
I never learned to pronounce
Now,
L-o-v-e's just another word I never learned to pronounce,
How do I say I'm sorry 'cause the word is never gonna come out,
Now,
L-o-v-e's just another word I never learned to pronounce
