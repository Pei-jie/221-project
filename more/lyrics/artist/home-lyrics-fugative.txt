It's like they've got me locked up Shackles no keys
They want me to play the game but the game right now aint playing with me
So keeping my cool keep on searching
Not singing much I keep on working
Cus I know they know this time round I won't be hurting
I open my eyes and now I can see
Everyone I talk to they seem to agree
Like this aint the place that you need to be
That's why I'm taking it over seas
Yea overseas with no other place than disbelieve
So the minute I'm out of this place there's no going back take it from me
Ed Sheeran
I keep on searching for my ticket out of here
But I foul myself when my destination disappears
The road is long I'm hoping you can take me home
And then I do it again
Fugative
Can't seem to make up my mind got leave this path behind
Ed Sheeran
And I'll find my way back home
And then I do it again
Fugative
Can't seem to make up my mind got leave this path behind
Ed Sheeran
And I'll find my way back home
And I'll find my way back home
Fugative
Cheer, still her but behind bars the whole sky's talking but no stars
Along the way I had so many chances now I got the keys but no cars
To many tracks and not enough dough to many fans that won't let go
In my mind it's only round the corner but how many times can you do the same show
Blowing up slow with a long lit fuse
Waiting around you don't need to approve
This is my life I do what I do let's take a walk step in my shoes
Yea step in my shoes and carry this journey and picture my views
I'm taking it back to how it should be
Cus this time round I aint gonna lose
Ed Sheeran
I keep on searching for my ticket out of here

Ed Sheeran
And I'll find my way back home
And then I do it again
Fugative

And I'll find my way back home
And I'll find my way back home
Sway
Sway!
I got the hard drive but it's packing up
Talk about the Zit but I can back it up
See call the politics you better had enough
But you were never going with the wind I had to draft
I thought a new plan you at the beginning of the path
Let me set the record straight Cus when I hit the decks they be cracking up
I'm not a one trick pony but you can set it up
Cus I'm bringing it home they say who's
They king of the thrown if it aint sway
My boy F telling them to make way
Fugative now listen to what they say
Cus they hate when you work late d
Real artist Van Gof ish
That's the reason why you brush them off Cus its and F'ed up picture that they paint aa
