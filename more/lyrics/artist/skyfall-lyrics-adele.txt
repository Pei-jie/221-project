This is the end,
Hold your breath and count to ten,
Feel the earth move and then,
Hear my heart burst again,
For this is the end,
I've drowned and dreamt this moment,
So overdue I owe them,
Swept away I'm stolen,
[Chorus]
Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together,
Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together,
At skyfall
At skyfall
Skyfall is where we start,
A thousand miles and poles apart,
Where worlds collide and days are dark,
You may have my number, you can take my name,
But you'll never have my heart,
[Chorus]
Let the skyfall (Let the skyfall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall.
[x2]
(Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall)
Where you go I go,
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security,
Of your loving arms,
Keeping me from harm,
Put your hand in my hand,
And we'll stand.
[Chorus]
Let the skyfall (Let the skyfall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Face it all together
Let the skyfall (Let the skyfall)
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall.
Let the skyfall
We will stand tall,
At skyfall,
Oooooh
