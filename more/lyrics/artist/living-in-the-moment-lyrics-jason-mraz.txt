If this life is one act
Why do we lay all these traps
We put them right in our path
When we just wanna be free
I will not waste my days
Making up all kinds of ways
To worry 'bout all the things
That will not happen to me
So I just let go
Of what I know I don't know
And I know I only do this by
Living in the moment
Living my life
Easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
With peace in my heart
With peace in my soul
Wherever I'm going,
I'm already home
Living in the moment
I'm letting myself off the hook
For things I've done
I let my past go past
And now I'm having more fun
I'm letting go of the thoughts
That do not make me strong
And I believe this way
Can feel the same for everyone
And if I fall asleep
I know you'll be the one
Who'll always remind me
To live in the moment
Living my life
Easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
With peace in my heart
With peace in my soul
Wherever I'm going,
I'm already home
I can't walk through life facing backwards
I have tried,
Tried more than once to just make sure
And I was denied
The future I'd been searching for
I spun around and hurt no more
By living in the moment
Living my life
Easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
With peace in my heart
With peace in my soul
Wherever I'm going,
I'm already home
I'm living in the moment
(I'm letting myself off)
I'm living my life
(The hook for things I've done)
Just takin' it easy
(I let my past go past)
With peace in my mind
(And now I'm having more fun)
Got peace in my heart
(I'm letting go of the thoughts)
Got peace in my soul
(That do not make me strong)
Wherever I'm going
(And I believe this way)
I'm already home
(Can be the same for everyone)
I'm living in the moment
(I'm letting myself off)
I'm living my life
(The hook for things I've done)
Easy and breezy
(I let my past go past)
With peace in my mind
(And now I'm having more fun)
With peace in my heart
(I'm letting go of the thoughts)
With peace in my soul
(That do not make me strong)
Wherever I'm going
(And I believe this way)
I'm already home
(Can be the same for everyone)
Living in the moment
