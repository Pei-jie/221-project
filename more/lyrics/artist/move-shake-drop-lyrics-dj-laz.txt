Hey! I wanna see you move and shake it

Uh huh, slim waist and Apple Bottoms she got
They look good all in my face
I like when they loose, Patron get abused

She bringing it back, throwin it around for niggas stacks
I think I'll give her the cash, do what she do with her ass
Me? What I think?
Shorty fine, damn right, I'm bout to lose my mind
So stacked know how to make they body wind, grind
I wanna press rewind
Now give it to me one time, give it to me two time
