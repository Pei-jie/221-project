rock
Leaning on a tree trunk
Thinking all the same junk
Falling in and out of a dream
Back and forth I'm swaying
I'm contemplating staying
Laying and decaying
When I know I must leave
Where do I aim when I shoot the breeze?
How do I calm myself at times like these?
I need a simple kind of lovely
And the *thought* is just a novelty
You can spend the whole time
Dangling from a grape vine
Standing underneath you
When they cut you free
What about when the sun leaves?
And what about all those bad dreams?
Who will walk you back into reality?
I wish things could be like this everyday
But I know that I could never live this way
It was just a simple kind of lovely
And the memories will be ok
The memories will be ok
Memories will be ok
