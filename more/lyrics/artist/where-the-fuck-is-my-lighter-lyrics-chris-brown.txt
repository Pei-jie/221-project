Hold up, hold up
What you sayin babe?
I Heard that your loves only a mile away
Movin slow, why am I wide awake?
All of this pain Im tryin to take away
Dont bother me
Dont even bother calling
Drinking tonight
Im an alcoholic
Now Im trying something new tonight,
Where the fuck is my lighter?
Im tired of all this shit
I want a lighter
Throw my drink in the fire
Just let me pass out,
I just wanna escape,
Turn the light s off,
I wanna black out,
We are not one and the same
So where the fuck is my lighter?
Imma take off while I can
While Im running with the flame
In the night time, Imma come alive
When Im seeing a crazy face
But none of em look the same
Imma let go
Just wanna let go
I hear what youre sayin
Got a liquor plan
Killin my brain is suicide
Veins burning up
It feels like Im gonna die
Ill take two shots
Fuck it if you watching
Give me the bottle
Imma down it
Imma run off with the Swisher
Where the fuck is my lighter?
Im tired of all this shit
I want a lighter
Throw my drink in the fire
Just let me pass out,
I just wanna escape,
Turn the light s off,
I wanna black out,
We are not one and the same
So where the fuck is my lighter?
