rock
There's this boy I know whose afraid of the ocean
Never quite found love he drank the love potion
I'll be on the chain smoking in the basement
Shattered like the windows
All my life I was born to lead
Worry not just leave me be
I'll abide till the end
I'll take it on the chin for you my friend
Find my bag of bones at the back of the station
Said make yourself at home
So I started day drinking
Till I believe in time after 7 8 or 9
You fall yourself to pieces
All my life I was born to lead
Worry not just leave me be
I'll abide till the end
I'll take it on the chin for you my friend
All my life I was born to lead
Worry not just leave me be I'll abide till the end
I'll take it on the chin for you my friend
I'll take it on the chin for you my friend
I'll take it on the chin for you my friend
