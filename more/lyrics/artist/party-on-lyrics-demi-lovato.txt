I saw you lookin' over, now I see you moving this way
You're pushing through the crowd like you got something to say-ay
But you couldn't walk 'cause the music's taken over your feet
I could tell by your toes that you're rocking to this beat
You gotta dance till you ache, till you drop, till you break
Free your soul, let me see you shake
One by one we're stealing the stage
Here we come, so get out of our way
Chorus:
It won't be long till the summer's gone
Get your party on
So sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on
So we're screaming out loud
Yow
I know your type and all the hype is going straight to your head
And everyone is stopping what they're doing 'cause your face is turning red
Yeah
Gotta learn how to move to the groove, get in or get out
Put your hands in the air, stand up in your chair and shout
You're all dolled up with no where to go
Wanna get out and put on a show
Nothing wrong with staying home
As long as you've got your radio
Chorus:
It won't be long till the summer's gone
Get your party on
So sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on
So scream it
Don't wait and don't you be late
Get your party on
So sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on
So we're screaming out loud
Come on
Dallas, Texas! [Yeah!]
Bring it home for me, baby!
The little things that you do
From across the room
I see you sending me clues
They're in the way you make me move
Chorus:
It won't be long till the summer's gone
Get your party on
So sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on
So scream it
Don't wait and don't you be late
Get your party on
So sing along
Hold on tight, it's a crazy night
Get your party on
And scream it out loud
Scream it out loud
[Get your party on]
Get your, get your
Party on
Let's do it again
