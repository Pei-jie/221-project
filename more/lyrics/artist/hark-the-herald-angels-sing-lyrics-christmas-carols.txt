Hark! The Herald Angels sing, glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth and mercy mild, God and sinners reconcile
Joyful all ye nations rise, join the triumph of the skies
With the angelic host proclaim, 'Christ is born in Bethlehem'
Hark! The Herald Angels sing, glory to the newborn King
Hail, the Heaven born Prince of peace, hail the Sun of righteousness
Light and life to all he brings, risen with healing in his wings
Mild he lays his glory by, born that man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth, born to give them second birth
Hark! The Herald Angels sing, glory to the newborn King
