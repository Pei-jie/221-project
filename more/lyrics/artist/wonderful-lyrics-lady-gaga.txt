if i fell in love with you,
would you understand me dear,
love is weird.
i colored you a valentine,
struggled just to stay inside the lines,
i loose my mind.
i really can't believe
i lost myself again
looking for something crazy
beautiful nothing
now I'm talking in circles again
let me know baby are you hungry
for wonderful cause i am
wonderful cause i am
i wrote a song about your eyes,
ate a slice of cherry pie,
i cried all night.
on a bench inside the park,
I'll kiss you slowly in the dark,
I'll never stop.
i really can't believe
i lost myself again
looking for something crazy
beautiful nothing
now I'm talking in circles again (oh-oh-oh)
let me know baby are you hungry
for wonderful cause i am
wonderful cause i am
baby take me for a ride
MAYBE get a little high
in a place we've never been
time is nothing but a line
we'd leave everything behind
it'd be so wonderful
wonderful
looking for something crazy
beautiful nothing
now I'm talking in circles again (oh-oh-oh)
let me know baby are you hungry
for wonderful cause i am
wonderful cause i am
wonderful i am, i am, i am,
i'm sayin it for you.
I am, i am you know how wonderful i am
wonderful i am
wonderful i...am
