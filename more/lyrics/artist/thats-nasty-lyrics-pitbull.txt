Pitbull
pop
What? What? What? What? Yeah
Pitbull in this, this Lil Jon checkin' in
Where my T golds at?
Twentyfo's on my truck, that's nasty
They spin when you stop, that's nasty
Twentyfo's on my truck, that's nasty
They spin when you stop, that's nasty
What? What? Aah, lets go
Pitbull's chillin' the bottom wit no deals
If them boys talk a lot then it's no reals
Shimmya, y'all, shimmy, yay, shimmy, yayo
Catch me wit piccolo riding on them thangs
Word of mouf, there's a drought on the streets
So who ever sitting on them k's is looking at some cheezle
But don't let them boys find out where the safehouse is at
And if it's where you lay your head, what kinda safehouse is that
You don't deserve to hold weight, you deserve to get robbed
Your the first to turn state
Those who got snitched on relate to
No matter what you do, heffer, damn gon' hate ya
That's just mother nature, ain't she a mother?
I know these bitches named bullets and they loved to date ya
Or better said they love to rape ya
From the bottom to A-town the game is ours now
Twentyfo's on my truck, that's nasty
They spin when you stop, that's nasty
Twentyfo's on my truck, that's nasty
They spin when you stop, that's nasty
Twentyfo's on my truck, that's nasty
They spin when you stop, that's nasty
Twentyfo's on my truck, that's nasty
They spin when you stop, that's nasty
What? What? Aah, let's go
I from the land where, you name it, every thing's crooked
Watch what you do 'coz, every thing's looking
Man these streets got ears and eyes
And they wanna know, it's all who, what, when and whys
So when you see me on them 24's spinning
You know the cut me a serious check
But for now I'm still grindin', fiending for a legging
That's some serious shit, ya
I'm involved in some serious shit, ya
I'm like TI, I'm serious bitch
I'm giving Miami a facelift
Y'all just face it
Don't believe it's wrong, just taste it
Twentyfo's on my truck, that's nasty
They spin when you stop, that's nasty
Twentyfo's on my truck, that's nasty
They spin when you stop, that's nasty
Twentyfo's on my truck, that's nasty
They spin when you stop, that's nasty
Twentyfo's on my truck, that's nasty
They spin when you stop, that's nasty
What? What? Aah, let's go
When I came in, mami, you know you nasty
Them bitch ass niggaz wanna blast me
Still punkn', gettin' crunked off that crunk juice
Hatin' 'coz your girl on me and she hate you
We gotta do nigga what cutlass dropped down on d'z
If you pump, it relocate your soul from the streets
Remember me lil G, A-town to the O
(O, o, o, o)
If you ain't got no money, I'ma get some from your hoe
What you hate dawg? My dawg got rhymes on singing
Get your hatin' dawg, my twentyfo's keep spinning
G'z up and whateva F down
Not a gat, bring some money, oh really? Go act a clown
Lay it up, pimp, get shot to the head
But y'all want my cutlass, now, I just want yo bread
Sport a lil platinum B-C and B-B
I'm thug nigga and you know this to the B
Don't hate the, the playa
Don't hate the, the game
Don't hate the, the playa
Don't hate the, the game
What? What? Aah, lets go
Twentyfo's on my truck, that's nasty
They spin when you stop, that's nasty
Twentyfo's on my truck, that's nasty
They spin when you stop, that's nasty
Twentyfo's on my truck, that's nasty
They spin when you stop, that's nasty
Twentyfo's on my truck, that's nasty
They spin when you stop, that's nasty
