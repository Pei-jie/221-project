(Intro 1)
When I hear the ocean calling
And I feel my spirit falling
I remember all Sorrento
Where I fell in love with you
Love a romance in the garden
(Intro 2)
Yes
Its the immigrants
Taking over
Mr. WorldWide
Flavio, Arianna, salute
Lets have some fun
When I hear the ocean calling (Sexy people)
Back to Sorrento, si, back to Sorrento
(Sexy people)
Back to Sorrento, si, back to Sorrento
(Sexy people)
Back to Sorrento, si, back to Sorrento
(Sexy people)
Back to Sorrento, si, back to Sorrento
(Sexy people)
Back to Sorrento, si, back to Sorrento
(Verse)
I was born in Miami, my blood is from Cuba
Cuban-American, dont let me fool ya
Hazme el favor y deja la bulla
Any doubts, has corulla
Ive been around the globe ripping and riding
Dipping and diving, running and gunning
Slipping and sliding, go ahead try me
Cant, your words too hard to deny
Love and romance in the garden
Taste your kisses, let's unwind
Take me to Sorrento
Keep me undone
(Chorus)
Sexy people all around the world
The night is young, lets have some fun
Sexy people all around the world
The night is young, lets have some fun
Sexy people all around the world
The night is young, lets have some fun
When I hear the ocean calling
Back to Sorrento si, back to Sorrento
Back to Sorrento si, back to Sorrento
Back to Sorrento si, back to Sorrento
Back to Sorrento si, back to Sorrento
(Verse)
I live for the freedom
Ride for the freedom
Die for the freedom,
Family left Cuba
All for the freedom,
Thats why all opportunities
Me lo como, I eat 'em
Global dominance, known through all seven continents
I flirt with the earth
She loves when I whisper in her ear and pull up her skirt
What a dirty girl
Love and romance in the Garden
Taste your kisses, let's unwind
Take me to Sorrento
Keep me undone
(Chorus)
Sexy people all around the world
The night is young, lets have some fun
Sexy people all around the world
The night is young, lets have some fun
Sexy people all around the world
The night is young, lets have some fun
When I hear the ocean calling
Back to Sorrento, si, back to Sorrento
Back to Sorrento, si, back to Sorrento
The ocean calling
Back to Sorrento, si, back to Sorrento
Back to Sorrento, si, back to Sorrento
(Chorus)
Sexy people all around the world
The night is young, lets have some fun
Sexy people all around the world
The night is young, lets have some fun (To Sorrento)
