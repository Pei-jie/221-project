Paramore
rock
Now when you say you wanna slow down
Does it mean you wanna slow dance?
Maybe you just want a little extra time to focus
On our romance
What do you mean I've "got it backwards"?
You know were gonna be forever...
Why are you telling me goodbye?
Arent you gonna stay the night?
(Well... alright)
Are we really over now?
Maybe I can change your mind
Soon as you walk out my door
Im gonna call a hundred times
Now I walk under a pink sky
Lovers float along and pass me by
I pour my heart out to your voicemail
Let you know I caught a bus to your side of town...
And now I'm standing at your doorstep
With Los Angeles behind me
If you don't answer I'll just use the key that I copied...
'Cause I really need to see you
If you're not here when I break in
Im gonna go through your closet
Just so I can smell your skin
As the chemicals swim,
I know Ill never love again
I swear Ill never love again
Baby, are we over now?
Maybe I can change your mind
As soon as you walk out my door
Im gonna call a hundred times
Im not one of those crazy girls
Im not one of those crazy girls
Im not one of those crazy girls
Im not one of those crazy girls
(Hey) baby, are we over now?
Maybe I can change your mind
As soon as you walk out my door
Im gonna call a hundred times
(Hey) baby, are we over now?
Maybe I can change your mind
As soon as you walk out my door
Im gonna call a hundred times
Oooh
Now Im one of those crazy girls
Now Im one of those crazy girls
Now Im one of those crazy girls
Now Im one of those crazy girls
