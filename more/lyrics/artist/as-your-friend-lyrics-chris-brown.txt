[Chris Brown]
I just cant live anymore like this
My heart just opened up the door again
Just watch me fly as I spread my wings
Dont ask me why coz there are too many things
And now were standing on the edge
Looking like, "here we go again"
I used to be your man but today
I woke up as your friend...
[Hook]
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend
[Beat break]
Oh lil mama, I can feel your fire
You poisonous lady, let me take you higher
And I dont care if its a bad time
Just label me the bad guy tonight
And now were standing on the edge
Looking like here we go again
I used to be your man but today
I woke up as your friend
[Beat break]
I came to party hoping that you would fall in love
Dont mean to put no pressure on you
Everybody loving madly
And the DJ, hes getting drunk
Trying to get next to you
And now were standing on the edge
Looking like here we go again
I used to be your man but today
I woke up as your friend
[Hook]
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend
I woke up, I woke up as your friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
As your friend, as your friend, as your friend
I woke up as your friend
[Beat break]
And now were standing on the edge
Looking like here we go again
I used to be your man but today
I woke up as your friend
[Beat break]
