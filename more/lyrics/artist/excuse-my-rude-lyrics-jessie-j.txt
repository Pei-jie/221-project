Ok
Let's Go
Me, me, me, me, me
That's all you ever talk about
Me, me, me, me, me
Sick of when you scream and shout
Me, me, me, me, me
So baby go and run your mouth
Run your mouth, run your mouth
I, I, I, I try and show you that I'm there
I, I, I, I end up ripping out my hair
Why I, I, I, I, do I even wanna care
Wanna care, wanna care, care
I can't believe
That this is what it's come to I've held in
But it's time you know the truth
Excuse my rude but I really hate you
I never thought that I'd be the one
To fall for it
And let you in
To mess it up once again
I'm over it so here it is
Excuse my rude, but I really hate you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
This isn't how it was before
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now I'm the girl you can't ignore
Now, ow, ow, ow, ow
I'm brave enough to say no more
No more, no more, no more, more
Do woo, woo, woo, woo you even want to understand?
Do woo, woo, woo, woo you think you're still in comand
Do woo, woo, woo, woo you see that I got the upper hand?
I can't believe
That this is what it's come to I've held in
But it's time you know the truth
Excuse my rude but I really hate you
I never thought that I'd be the one
To fall for it
And let you in
To mess it up once again
I'm over it so here it is
Excuse my rude but I really hate you
They say 'hate' is a strong word
But I got that urge
Treat me like a waiter
So you better get served
With that Becky G Special
I'm shaking your credentials
Acting like a Benz
But to me you just a rental
Keep it simple, it's not about the cars acting hard
It's too easy, boy, you gotta please me
Believe me, so I hit you in the telly
When I'm your areay next February
I can't believe
That this is what it's come to I've held in
But it's time you know the truth
Excuse my rude but I really hate you
I never thought that I'd be the one
To fall for it
And let you in
To mess it up once again
I'm over it so here it is
Excuse my rude but I really hate you
