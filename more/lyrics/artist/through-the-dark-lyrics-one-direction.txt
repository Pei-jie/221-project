Liam
You tell me that you're sad and lost your way
You tell me that your tears are here to stay
But I know you were only hiding
And I just wanna see you
You tell me that you're hurt, and you're in pain
And I can see it here, it's so in shake
But I just wanna see your smile again
See you smile again
Niall
But don't burn out
Even if you scream and shout
It will come back to you
And I'll be here for you
Oh I will carry you over, fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on you
We will find a way through the dark
Zayn
I wish that I could take you to the stars
I'd never let you fall and break your heart
And if you wanna cry or fall apart
I'll be there to hold you
Louis
You tell me that you heard it's all in vain
But I can see your heart can love again
And I remember you laughing
So let's just laugh again
Niall
But don't burn out
Even if you scream and shout
It will come back to you, back to you
Oh I will carry you over, fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on you
We will find a way through the dark
Zayn
And you don't need
You don't need to worry
And you will see it's easy to love
I know you wanna be loved
Liam
Oh I will carry you over, fire and water for your love
Oh I will carry you over, fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on you
We will find a way through the dark
Oh I will carry you over, fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down
We will find a way through the dark
