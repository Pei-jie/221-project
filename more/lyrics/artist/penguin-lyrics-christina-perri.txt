Can you find the time to let your lover love you?
He only wants to show you the things he wants to learn too
The hardest parts you'll get through
And in the end, you'll have your best friend
Love like this may come once, baby it's fate
Like a soul mate, he's your penguin
Baby it's fate, baby it's fate, not luck
Can you find the time to let your lover hold you?
He needs somebody to hold too
His love is strong and so true, his arrow is aiming for you
And he's the one that you were born to love
Love like this may come once, baby it's fate
Like a soul mate, he's your penguin
Baby it's fate, baby it's fate, not luck
Let go, let go of time for you and I
Let go, let go of time for you and I
Let go, let go of time for you and I
Love like this is all I want, baby we're fate
Love like this may come once, baby we're fate
Like a soul mate, you're my penguin
Baby we're fate, baby it's fate, not luck
