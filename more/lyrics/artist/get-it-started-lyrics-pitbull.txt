[Pitbull]
To these rappers I apologize
I know it ain't fair
Only ball I drop
New Years, Times Square
The world is mine
Sixth Sense, I see the Seven Signs
Now baby, let's get started for life
[Chorus]
Everytime I look into your eyes (Mr. Worldwide)
I feel like I could stare in them for a lifetime
We can get started for life (tonight)
For life (tonight) for life (tonight)
We can get started for life (tonight)
For life (tonight) for life (tonight)
We can get started
(You know it feels right)
[Pitbull]
Big news, Pitbull, Tom Cruise, Mumbai
I lit up their December nights like the fourth of july, Vanilla Sky
Thrilla in manila, knocking them out like pacquiao
No Ali, No Frazier
But for now it's off to Malaysia
Two Passports, Three Cities
Two Countries, One Day
Now that's worldwide
If you think it's a game, let's play
Dale
[Chorus]
Everytime I look into your eyes (Mr. Worldwide)
I feel like I could stare in them for a lifetime
We can get started for life (tonight)
For life (tonight) for life (tonight)
We can get started for life (tonight)
For life (tonight) for life (tonight)
We can get started
(You know it feels right)
[Pitbull]
I am what they thought I'd never become
I believed and became it
Now I'm here to claim it
I hustle anything you name it, name it
I went from eviction to food stamps
To baggin work wet and damp
To a passport flooded with stamps
Now it's Voli everywhere I land
Two Passports, Three Cities
Two Countries, One Day
Now that's worldwide
If you think it's a game, let's play
Dale
[Shakira]
Cause if it feels right (you know it feels right)
We shouldn't waste anymore time
Let's get it started (let's get it started)
Don't think about it (let's get it started)
You know I'm going to make it alright, alright (let's go)
Cause if it feels right
You know I made up my mind
Let's get it started (let's get it started)
Don't think about it (let's get it started)
I know that we can make it alright, alright
[Chorus]
Everytime I look into your eyes (Mr. Worldwide)
I feel like I could stare in them for a lifetime
We can get started for life (tonight)
For life (tonight) for life (tonight)
We can get started for life (tonight)
For life (tonight) for life (tonight)
We can get started
Don't start what you can't finish
You know it feels right
Let's go
You know it feels right
