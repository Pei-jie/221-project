If you could envision
The meaning of a tragedy
Ooh, you might be
Surprised to hear it's you and me
But when it comes down to it
You never made the most of it
Ooh, so I cried, cried, cried
And now I say goodbye
And I won't be made a fool of
Don't call this love
When did you decide
That I didn't have enough to buy?
Forgive and forget you a thousand times
For the fire and the sleepless nights
And I won't be made a fool of
Don't call this love
Don't call this love
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, love
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, love
La, la, love
Why did you feel the need
To prove that everybody else was right?
No, I won't fight
Oh, you're my tragedy, tragedy
You're my tragedy
Oh, this is, oh, oh, oh, oh, no, no, no
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, love
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, love
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, love
