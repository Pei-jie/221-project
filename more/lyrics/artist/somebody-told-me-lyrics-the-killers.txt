rock
Breaking my back
Just to know your name
Seventeen tracks
And I've had it with this game
I'm breaking my back
Just to know your name
But heaven ain't close
In a place like this
Anything goes
But don't blink you might miss
Cause heaven ain't close
In a place like this
I said heaven ain't close
In a place like this
Bring it back down
Bring it back down tonight, hoo hoo
Never thought I'd let a rumor
Ruin my moonlight
Well somebody told me
You had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential
I've got potential
Ready? Let's roll
Onto something new
Taking its toll
And I'm leaving without you
Ready? Let's roll
Onto something new
Cause heaven ain't close
In a place likethis
Heaven ain't close
So don't blink you might miss
Cause heaven ain't close
In a place like this
I said heaven ain't close
In a place like this
Bring it back down
Bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor
Ruin my moonlight
Well somebody told me
You had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential
I've got potential
A rushin', a rushin' around
Pace yourself from me
I said maybe, baby please
But I just don't know now
When all I wanna do is try
But somebody told me
You had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential
I've got potential
A rushin', a rushin' around
Somebody told me
You had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential
I've got potential
A rushin', a rushin' around
Somebody told me
You had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential
I've got potential
A rushin', a rushin' around
