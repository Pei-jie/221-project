Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make him mine, mine, oh Santa
Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make him mine, mine, oh Santa
Santa, if you get this letter won't you help me out?
I know you're kinda busy with your elves right now
And I don't know how
How do you do while I sleep on Christmas Eve
But it's amazing
And I bet that you could bring me back my baby
Because every time I see Christmas lights
I feel this burn inside and I just can't take it
I saw them shopping last week
And his new girl was so bleak
And then I swore to myself
Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas night
Ho-ho-ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, ho-ho-ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Oh Santa, I heard that it's really gonna snow this year
So I hope Rudolph and them other 8 reindeer
Get you safely here
So you can scoop him up and swoop him right down my chimney
I've been really, really, really good this year
So put on that red suit and make him appear
This Christmas cheer just ain't the same without my baby
Come on, oh Kris Kringle, send me help
They say it's unrealistic
But I believe in you, Saint Nick
So grant this wish for me right quick
Santa won't you come and make him mine this Christmas night
Ho-ho-ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, ho-ho-ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas night
Oh Santa, oh Santa
Oh, oh, oh Santa
C'mon Santa
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, mine
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, mine
Oh Santa Claus, if you get this letter please don't make me wait
'Cause all December I'll be counting down the days
Hop on your sleigh
I promise that I won't forget the milk and cookies
The tree's all sparkly and gold
But inside I feel so cold
So soon as you leave the North Pole
Santa won't you come and make him mine this Christmas?
Santa's gonna come and make you mine ho-ho-ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine ho-ho-ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, mine
Santa's gonna come and make you mine ho-ho-ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine ho-ho-ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, mine
Santa's gonna come and make you mine ho-ho-ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine ho-ho-ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, mine
