[Intro]
Mr. Worldwide Im self-made, Im self-paid
I grew up with no daddy, Im from Miami Dade
Im self-made, Im self-paid
I grew up with no daddy, Im from Miami Dade
[Verse 1]
Mouth signed check, ass cant cash
One-time Lebron boss, D-Wade flash
Cant forget that boy UD, Udonis Has
Im from Miami Dade Country, born and raised there
Mouth full of gold and diamonds, but talk is cheap
Theres rules and codes, in Dade Country streets
Yall break rules and codes to talk shit on beats
Dont think he wont get me, he done, Mamill bring the heat
[Hook]
Im self-made, Im self-paid
I grew up with no daddy, Im from Miami Dade
Im self-made, Im self-paid
I grew up with no daddy, Im from Miami Dade
Welcome to Dade County
Welcome to, welcome to Dade County
Welcome to, welcome to Dade County
Welcome to, welcome to Dade County
[Verse 2]
Here a deposition, watch what you speak
Whos the definition of Miami? Me
I move cultures, dont believe me watch and see
Ask Barack Obama, hell bet the White House on me
You got money, yeah yeah, thats sweet
But we are no slimmin, baby, really eat
You talk Miami, if you talkin heat
Moral of the story: dont shit where you eat
[Hook]
[Outro]
I had to do this for my city, dog
Its something I love so deeply
I dont wanna be 305 Miami Dade Country
I am 305 Miami Dade Country
I bleed 305 Miami Dade Country
So when we show love to those
That get their city destroyed by a hurricane
And then they come down here
