And I've been meaning to say this to you
That my heart isn't black and blue anymore
And your words don't mean a thing
And they're sung in vain
And maybe I was wrong
I only remember feeling so alone
This isn't were I meant to lay down
But you dug this grave, fits me perfectly
And if you're asking if I'm over love
You're a fool to believe that you gave me some
And it's been raining here like it never should
And I can't help believe it's because you're coming
And you tried once to run away and you tried once to hide
But don't come following your fantasy
'Cause you might be surprised, she'll run right back inside
And maybe I was wrong
I only remember feeling so alone
This isn't where I meant to lay down
But you dug this grave, fits me perfectly
And if you're asking if I'm over love
You're a fool to believe
Fool to believe, fool to believe
This isn't were I meant to lay down
But you dug this grave, fits me perfectly
And if you're asking if I'm over love
You're a fool to believe that you gave me some
This isn't were I meant to lay down
But you dug this grave, fits me perfectly
And if you're asking if I'm over love
You're a fool to believe
You're a fool to believe
That you gave me some
