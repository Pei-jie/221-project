You say you need someone but everybody does
I'm no different than you, I just believe what I do
You point your finger at everyone but yourself
And blame the ones that you love who're only try'n to help
As it's winding down to zero I am yours like a hero
I'll see this through there's so much me and you
Take this enemy together, fight these demons off forever
Forever, forever, forever
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all
I have no time for fear or people in my ear
Head down and running so fast, try not to dwell on the past
I'm fighting through this pain and things I cannot change
Running right into the flame rather than running away
As it's winding down to zero I am yours like a hero
I'll see this through, there's so much me and you
Take this enemy together, fight these demons off forever
Forever, forever, forever
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all
Sweat drips down from every angle
Love your body as it gathers in a pool by your feet
You turn up the heat, tossin' and turnin', you cannot sleep
Quietly weep, you're in too deep
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all
