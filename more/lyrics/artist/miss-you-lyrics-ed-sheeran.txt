Shock, horror, i'm down
Lost, your not around
There's a lump in my chest that
Sends cold through my head and
My mind shuts sound out
I'm on autopilot
And my tongues gone silent
Just switch it off and lay it down
Lay it down, next to me
I don't know when i lost my mind
Maybe when i made you mine
Wooooohhh ohhhhh
I don't know when i lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you saaaaaid
That i miss you
That i miss you
These words mean nothing to me
I'm just in on a fence of how it used to be
These three words, are aching
Constrict them, suffocating
My mind is racing
With the picture i'm painting
And my belly's sick to its stomach
When i remember all the times he was with you
When you laid it dowwwn
When you laid down, next to me
I don't know when i lost my mind
Maybe when i made you mine
Wooooohhh ohhhhh
I don't know when i lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you saaaaaid
That i miss you, more then i let on
I kissed you, far to long
I'll let go, as soon as you do
See i know, were not through
I don't know when i lost my mind
maybe when i made you mine
Wooooooah ohhhhhh
I dont know when i lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you saaaaid
That I miss you
That i miss you
Wooooaahhh
I don't know when i lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you saaaaaaid
That i miss you
