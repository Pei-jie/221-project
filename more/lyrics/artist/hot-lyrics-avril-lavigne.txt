You're so good to me, baby baby
I want to lock you up in my closet
Where no one's around
I want to put your hand in my pocket
Because you're allowed
I want to drive you into the corner
And kiss you without a sound
I want to stay this way forever
I'll say it loud
Now you're in and you can't get out
You make me so hot, make me wanna drop
You're so ridiculous, I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe, you make me wanna scream
You're so fabulous, you're so good to me, baby baby
You're so good to me, baby baby
I can make you feel all better
Just take it in
And I can show you all the places
You've never been
And I can make you say everything
That you never said
And I will let you do anything
Again and again
Now you're in and you can't get out
You make me so hot, make me wanna drop
You're so ridiculous, I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe, you make me wanna scream
You're so fabulous, you're so good to me, baby baby
You're so good to me, baby baby
Kiss me gently
Always I know
Hold me, love me
Don't ever go, yeah
You make me so hot, make me wanna drop
You're so ridiculous, I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe, you make me wanna scream
You're so fabulous, you're so good to me
You make me so hot, make me wanna drop
You're so ridiculous, I can barely stop
I can hardly breathe, you make me wanna scream
You're so fabulous, you're so good to me, baby baby
You're so good to me, baby baby
You're so good
