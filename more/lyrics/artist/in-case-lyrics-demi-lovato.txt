Pictures in my pocket
Are faded from the washer
I can barely just make out your face
Food you saved for later
In my refrigerator
Its been too long since later never came
I know
One day eventually
Yeah I know
One day I'll have to let it all go
But I keep it just in case
Yeah I keep it just in case
In case you dont find what youre looking for
In case youre missing what you had before
In case you change your mind, I'll be waiting here
In case you just want to come home
Strong enough to leave you
But weak enough to need you
Cared enough to let you walk away
I took that dirty jacket
From the trash right where you left it
Cause I couldnt stand to see it go to waste
I know
One day eventually
Yeah I know
One day I'll have to let it all go
But I keep it just in case
Yeah I keep it just in case
In case you dont find what youre looking for
In case youre missing what you had before
In case you change your mind, I'll be waiting here
In case you just want to come home
In case youre looking in that mirror one day
And miss my arms, how they wrapped around your waist
I say that you can love me again
Even if it isnt the case
Oh, you dont find what youre looking for
Oh, youre missing my love
You dont find what youre looking for
In case youre missing what you had before
In case you change your mind, I'll be waiting
In case you just want to come home
In case
