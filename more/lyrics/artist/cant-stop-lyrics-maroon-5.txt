All alone in my room, think of you
At a rate that is truly alarming
I keep looping my memories of you in my head
I pretend that you want me
And I fall asleep
And dream of alternate realities
And I put myself at ease
By pretending that she still loves me
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
And you never could or would do what I do
And I can't stop thinking about your love
Can't believe I could think that she would
Just follow me everywhere I go
I just wrestle with you in my dreams
And wake up making love to a pillow
And I fall asleep
And dream of alternate realities
And I put myself at ease
By pretending that she still loves me
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You never could or would do what I do
And I can't stop and I can't stop
What I would give to have you look in my direction?
And I'd give my life to somehow attract your attention
And I touch myself like it's somebody else
Thoughts of you attached to, on my mind, let me show you
I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
And you never could or would do what I do
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
I can't stop thinking about you
And you never could or would do what I do
I can't stop thinking about you
