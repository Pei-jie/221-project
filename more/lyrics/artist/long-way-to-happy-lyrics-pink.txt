One night to you, lasted six weeks for me
Just a bitter little pill now, just to try to go to sleep
No more waking up to innocence, say hello to hesitance
To everyone I meet, thanks to you years ago
I guess I'll never know, what love means to me
But, oh, I'll keep on rolling down this road
But I've got a bad, bad feeling
It's gonna take a long time to love, it's gonna take a lot to hold on
It's gonna be a long way to happy, yeah
Left in the pieces that you broke me into
Torn apart but now I've got to, keep on rolling like a stone
'Cause it's gonna be a long, long way to happy
Left my childhood behind, in a roll away bed
Everything was so damn simple, now I'm losing my head
Trying to cover up the damage and pad out all the bruises
To young to know I had it so it didn't hurt to lose it
Didn't hurt to lose it
No but oh, I'll keep on rolling down this road
But I've got a bad, bad feeling
It's gonna take a long time to love, it's gonna take a lot to hold on
It's gonna be a long way to happy, yeah
Left in the pieces that you broke me into
Torn apart but now I've got to, keep on rolling like a stone
'Cause it's gonna be a long, long way
Now I'm numb as hell and I can't feel a thing
But don't worry about regret or guilt 'cause I never knew your name
I just want to thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart
For all the sleepless nights and for tearing me apart, yeah, yeah
It's gonna take a long time to love, it's gonna take a lot to hold on
It's gonna be a long way to happy, yeah
Left in the pieces that you broke me into
Torn apart but now I've got to, keep on rolling like a stone
'Cause it's gonna be a long, long way
It's gonna take a long time to love, it's gonna take a lot to hold on
It's gonna be a long, long, long, long way to happy, yeah
Left in the pieces that you broke me into
Torn apart but now I've got to, keep on rolling like a stone
'Cause it's gonna be a long, long way to happy
'Cause it's gonna be a long, long way to happy
