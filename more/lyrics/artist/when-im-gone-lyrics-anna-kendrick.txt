verse 1
i got my ticket for the long way round
two bottle a whiskey for the way
and i sure would like some sweet company
and im leaving tommrow wha-do-ya say?
chorus 1
when im gone
when im gone
your gonna miss me when im gone
your gonna miss me by my hair
your gonna miss me everywhere,oh
your gonna miss me when im gone
verse 2
i got my ticket for the long way around
the one with the prettiest of views
its got mountains,its got rivers,its got sights to give you shivers
but it would sure be prettier with you
chorus 2
when im gone
when im gone
your gonna miss me when im gone
your gonna miss me by my walk,oh
your gonna miss me by my talk
your gonna miss me when im gone
