I really, I really, I really need to know
I really, I really
Or else you gotta let me go
I really, I really
This time I really need to do things right
Shivers that you give me
Keep me freezing all night
You make me shut up, oh yeah
I can't believe it, I'm not myself
Certainly I'm thinking about no one else
You make me shut up
I really, I really need to know
Or else you gotta let me go
You're just a fantasy, girl, it's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I give you everything, pay some attention to me
All I want is just you and me always
Give me affection, I need your perfection
'Cause it feels so good to make me
S-stutter, stutter
If I could touch you, I'd never let go
Now you got me screaming and I cannot shut up, oh, shut up, yeah
Now I am lying on a bedroom floor
Barely even speaking, and I cannot get up
And I really, I really, I really need to know
Or else you gotta let me go
You're just a fantasy, girl, it's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I give you everything, pay some attention to me
All I want is you and me always
Give me affection, I need your perfection
'Cause you feel so good, you make me
S-stutter, stutter, stutter
(I really, I really)
You knock me down, I can't get up
I'm stuck, gotta stop shaking me up
I can't eat, can't sleep, can't think sane
Get under, I'm sinking under
You're just a fantasy, girl, it's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I give you everything, pay some attention to me
All I want is you and me always
You're just a fantasy, girl, it's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
Give me affection, I need your perfection
'Cause it feels so good to make me
S-stutter
(I really, I really)
You make me s-stutter
(I really, I really)
You make me s-stutter
