rock
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone,
Baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember,
The people we used to be.
It's even harder to picture,
That you're not here next to me.
You say it's too late to make it,
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted,
All of our bridges burned down
I'm wasting my nights,
You turned out the lights,
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time,
When we called it love,
But even the sun
Sets in paradise.
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone,
Baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist,
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick
Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow
Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away.
You can't expect me to be fine,
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before,
But all of our bridges burned down.
I've wasted my nights,
You turned out the lights,
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in the time, when we called it love,
But even the sun
Sets in paradise.
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone,
Baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist,
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fuckin' love song, I'll be sick
Now, I'm at a payphone.
Man fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting 'round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came
Up with nothing. Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunning,
And all of my cars start
With the push of a button.
Telling me the chances I blew up
Or whatever you call it,
Switched the number to my phone
So you never could call it,
Don't need my name on my show,
You can tell it I'm ballin'.
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game
But you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see
At the top or what you could've saw
But sad to say it's over for.
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away
Got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go and take
That little piece of shit with you.
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you.
Where have the times gone?
Baby it's all wrong.
Where are the plans we made for two?
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this.
All those fairy tales are full of shit.
One more fuckin' love song, I'll be sick.
Now, I'm at a payphone.
