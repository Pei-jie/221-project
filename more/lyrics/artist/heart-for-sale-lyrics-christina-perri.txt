I've got a heart for sale
It's a little worn and torn and pale
If it beats, then I'll make you a deal
I'll give it to you for free
If you can love it, carefully
And get, it away from me
I know that I should keep it for a while
And learn what it may need to survive
But I can't, no I won't make it through
One more loveless bruise
I can't seem to get it right
But I try and try and try
In the end, I just lose all the fights
And crawl back home to hope my heart
Can make it through
Another night of the same, oh pain
I know that I should keep it for a while
And learn what it may need to survive
But I can't, no, I won't take it through
One more loveless bruise
I'll give you a try if you're not satisfied
Then send it back
And I'll mend the cracks
And I'll look for another buyer
I know that I should keep it for a while
And learn what it needs to survive
But I can't, no, I won't make it through
One more loveless bruise
Tired of being used
You don't know what I've been through
