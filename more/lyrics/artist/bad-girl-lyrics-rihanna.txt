I guess you know I'm bad
(Bad)
I got a problem
Shopaholic is what they call 'em
My addiction, my prescription
Gimme shoes and give me bags
How much you want I need 'em bad
All them girls be checking my bags
While they be jockin' my swag
I guess you know I'm bad
(Bad)
What a bad little girl I am
(I got a problem, bad, bad)
What a bad little girl I am
(I need you to solve it, bad, bad)
What a bad little girl I am
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
What a bad little girl I am
(I got a problem, bad, bad)
What a bad little girl I am
(I need you to solve it, bad, bad)
What a bad little girl I am
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Need no bargain, need no sale
I want the best, I dress me well
Love Cavalli dipped in Versace
Chick ain't cheap and everybody knows
All them girls be checking my bags
While they be jockin' my swag
I guess you know I'm bad
(Bad)
What a bad little girl I am
(I got a problem, bad, bad)
What a bad little girl I am
(I need you to solve it, bad, bad)
What a bad little girl I am
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
What a bad little girl I am
(I got a problem, bad, bad)
What a bad little girl I am
(I need you to solve it, bad, bad)
What a bad little girl I am
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
She a bad girl, a real shopaholic
She buying everything up, man, I can't call it
And she a walking store, I'm talking 'bout her clothes
I just pause, I'm in awe 'cause she a fashion show
Real Louis bags and breathe Gucci
Got a wardrobe like she's staring in a movie
And she ain't even famous but she got her own groupies
She got her own groupies, she got her own groupies
What a bad little girl I am
(I got a problem, bad, bad)
What a bad little girl I am
(I need you to solve it, bad, bad)
What a bad little girl I am
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
What a bad little girl I am
(I got a problem, bad, bad)
What a bad little girl I am
(I need you to solve it, bad, bad)
What a bad little girl I am
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
