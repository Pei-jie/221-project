The way I love you
I can't get to know you
I could try
But I don't want anyone but barely sweet tonight
Your bed, before you
Your trust, you know you
I could choose
But I don't want anything bad to come of you
We are born
We're hopeless on our own
But every chance we get we run
Every chance we get we run
We are shown
We're helpless on our own
But every chance we get we run
Every chance we get we run
The tears, spill on you
It seems beyond on you
You could try
But you don't want anyone, together spend the night
A stage before us
A song, a chorus
We could try
But we don't want anything to change our mood tonight
We are born
We're hopeless on our own
But every chance we get we run
Every chance we get we run
We are shown
We're helpless on our own
But every chance we get we run
Every chance we get we run
