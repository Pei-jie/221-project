Wheels are turning; I remember when you were mine.
Now just to reach you, baby I'd stand in line.
But there's another world you're living in tonight.
And there's another heart that's fading in the light.
Don't want your picture on my cell phone.
I want you here with me.
Don't want your memory in my head, no.
I want you here with me.
Spent the summer just laying out in the sun.
Time seems to move so slowly,
When you're taking it as it comes.
Maybe we were just too young.
Your body was tan and your hair was long.
You shot me a smile and my cares were gone.
When falling in love filled my soul with fright.
You said, Come on baby, it'll be all right.
I must've been a fool to the bitter end.
Now I hold on to hope to have you back again.
Id bargain and Id fight.
But there's another world you're living in tonight.
Don't want your picture on my cell phone.
I want you here with me.
Don't want your memory in my head, no.
I want you here with me.
Well, I saw you in a restaurant, the other day,
And instead of walking towards you, I ran away.
(Ran away)
And Ill keep on waiting for you
For you to come around, come around and say:
I don't want your picture on my cell phone.
I want you here with me.
Don't need those memories in my head, no.
I want you here with me.
Ohhhhh Ohhhhhhohhhhohhh
(Here with me)
Ooooohhhhh ohhhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhh Ohhhhhhohhhhohhh
(Here with me)
