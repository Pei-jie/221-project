This is for my people's who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady
Put your hand way up high, we'll never say bye
Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins
This is for my people's who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky 'cause we will never say bye
As a child there were them times
I didn't get it but you kept me alive
I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes on Sunday mornings
And I miss you, but I'm glad we talked through
All them grown full things separation brings
You never let me know it, you never let it show
Because you loved me and obviously
There's so much more left to say
If you were with me today face to face
I never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life goes on like
I wish I could talk to you for awhile
Miss you but i try not to cry
As time goes by
And It's true that you reached a better place
Still I'd give the whole world to see your face
And I'm right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
And you never got the chance to see how good I've done
And you never got to see me back at number one
I wish that you were here to celebrate together
I wish that we could spend the holidays together
I remember when you used to tuck me in at night
With the teddy bear you gave me that I held so tight
I thought you were so strong you'd make it through whatever
It's so hard to accept the fact you're gone forever
I never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life goes on like
I wish I could talk to you for awhile
Miss you but i try not to cry
As time goes by
And I know that you've reached a better place
Still I'll give the world to see your face
And I'm right here next to you
It feels like you've gone too soon
The hardest thing to do is say bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
This is for my people's who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady
Put your hand way up high, we will never say bye
Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins
This is for my people's who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky 'cause we will never say bye, bye
I never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life goes on
I wish I could talk to you for awhile
Miss you but i try not to cry
As time goes by
And soon as you reached a better place
Still I'll give the world to see your face
And I'm right here next to you
It feels like you gone too soon
The hardest thing to do is say bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
