[Verse 1]
You're stuck in the playground and I'm a grown woman now
Considering you hate me, you're stalking like you made me
[Pre 1]
So why you acting like you're tough
By now I'd thought you'd had enough
Don't you get tired of being rude
(Awww come and give me a hug dude)
(Lets go)
[Chorus 1]
It's my party
I'll do do what i want, do do what i want
So while you sit and watch me
I'll keep dancing alone, d dancing alone
So put this record on and keep it going till i say stop
If you are wondering if i give a damn well i do not ('coz)
It's my party i'll do do what i want
(woah woah)
(woah woah)
[Verse 2]
I think it's time you realise, you're only wasting your time
Addicted to attention, you need an intervention
[Pre 2]
So why you acting like you're sick, sitting around and talking shh
Don't you get tired of being alone
(Awww your only friend is your phone)
(Ow)
[Chorus 2]
It's my party
I'll do do what i want, do do what i want
So while you sit and watch me
I'll keep dancing alone, d dancing alone
So put this record on and keep it going till i say stop
If you are wondering if i give a damn well i do not ('coz)
It's my party i'll do do what i want
(woah woah)
(woah woah)
[Bridge 1]
You think i speak too much (I don't care, I don't care)
You think i tweet too much (I don't care, I don't care)
You think my clothes are crazy (I don't care, I don't care)
Well maybe I'm crazy, cray cray cray
[Chorus 3]
It's my party
I'll do do what i want, do do what i want
So while you sit and watch me
I'll keep dancing alone, d dancing alone
So put this record on and keep it going till i say stop
If you are wondering if i give a damn well i do not ('coz)
It's my party I'll do do what i want
(woah woah)
(woah woah)
