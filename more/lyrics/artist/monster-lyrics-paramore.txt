Paramore
rock
You were my conscience
So solid, now you're like water
And we started drowning
Not like we'd sink any farther
But I let my heart go
It's somewhere down at the bottom
But I'll get a new one
And come back for the hope that you've stolen
I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world... from turning into a monster
Eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder how we survived
Now that you're gone
The world is ours
I'm only human
I've got a skeleton in me
But I'm not the villain
Despite what you're always preaching
Call me a traitor
I'm just collecting your victims
And they're getting stronger
I hear them calling
(Calling, calling)
I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world... from turning into a monster
Eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder how we survived
Now that you're gone
The world is ours
When you find a strength and solutions
But I like the tension
And not always knowing the answers
Well you're gonna lose it... You're gonna lose it
I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world... from turning into a monster
Eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder how we survived
Now that you're gone
The world
I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world... from turning into a monster
Eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder how we survived
Now that you're gone
The world is ours
