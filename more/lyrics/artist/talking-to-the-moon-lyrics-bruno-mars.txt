I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I want you back
I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I have
You're all I have
At night when the stars
Light up my room
I sit by myself
Talking to the moon, tryin' to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or, am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon
I'm feeling like I'm famous
The talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
'Cause when the sun goes down
Someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back
At night when the stars
Light up my room
I sit by myself
Talking to the moon, tryin' to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or, am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon
Ahh ahhh ahhh
Do you ever hear me calling?
Ahh ahhh ahhh
'Cause every night
I'm talking to the moon, still tryin' to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or, am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon
I know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away.
