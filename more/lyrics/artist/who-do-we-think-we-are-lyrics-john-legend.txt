[Intro: John Legend]
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
[Verse 1: John Legend]
We made a lot of magic
Its the only way we know
Lets keep the night fantastic
Light it up, til we both, explode
We love, we love, we love, we love the stars
We could fall so hard
The drinks, the minks, the jewels, the house, the cars
Whyd we ball so hard?
Yeah, Im no afraid to fly
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing
And were not afraid to die
[Hook: John Legend]
Yeah, Im no afraid to fly
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing
And were not afraid to die
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
[Bridge: John Legend]
Weve got a lot of nerve, girl
We walk around here like we own this place
[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
See my jewels dripping on my Timberlands
Stepping like a criminal, success is so imminent
Pink champagne, black Rolls Royce
Eggplant double breasted suit from Tom Ford
Bon voyage, left haters in the fog
Look up in the sky, bet you recognize a boss
Look into my eyes as I fantasize for us
Still actin shy like this is summer class crush
Money comin fast, Im never in a rush, no
Plus another twenty in the tuck
Send me in a truck, another forty on the wrist
Quarter-mill on my mind got me livin like I pitch
Dodging Robin Givens, balling like Im Roger Clemens
Still in the game, uniform all linen
She get Chanel, ski trips to Ville
Only the highest grade, like trees that I inhale
[Hook]
[Outro: John Legend]
Who do we think we are?
I dont know about yall, but I feel good tonight
Theres something in the air tonight
You know, everyone needs someone to look up to
Why shouldnt it be us?
Who do we think we are?
Tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
Tell me, who do we think we are?
This is our song our song for the future
