[Liam]
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
[Zayn]
He takes your hand
I die a little
I watch your eyes
And I'm in riddles
Why can't you look at me like that
[Liam]
Na na na na na
When you walk by
I try to say it
But then I freeze
And never do it
My tongue gets tied
The words get trapped
[Harry]
I hear the beat of my heart getting louder
Whenever I'm near you
[All]
But I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him
I'm breaking
[Zayn]
Oh, how I wish that was me
[Liam]
Na na na na na
Na na na na na
[Harry]
(Zayn on harmonies)
He looks at you
The way that I would
Does all the things
I know that I could
If only time, could just turn back
[Zayn]
(Niall on harmonies)
'Cause I've got three little words
That I've always been dying to tell you
[All]
But I see you with him slow dancing
Tearing me apart
'Cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him
I'm breaking
[Harry]
(Zayn on harmonies)
Oh, how I wish that was me
With my hands on your waist
While we dance in the moonlight
I wish it was me
That you call later on
'Cause you wanna say good night
[Liam]
(Harry on harmonies)
'Cause I see you with him
Slow dancing
Tearing me apart
Cause you don't see
[All]
But I see you with him slow dancing
Tearing me apart
Cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him
I'm breaking
[Harry]
Oh, how I wish
[Zayn]
Oh, how I wish
[Harry]
Oh, how I wish, that was me
[Zayn]
Oh, how I wish, that was me
