You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
down your shoulders and back.
We are surrounded by all of these lies
and people who talk too much
You've got the kind of look in your eyes
as if no one knows anything but us.
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love
I'm so in love
so in love
so in love
You look so beautiful in this light
your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
is the Tenerife Sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
they just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and they will disappear into the wilderness
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love
I'm so in love
so in love
so in love
so in love
pull me in darling
blew the air over me
pull me in darling
blew the air over me
pull me in darling
blew the air over me
pull me in darling
blew the air over me
pull me in darling
blew the air over me
pull me in darling
blew the air over me
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love
I'm so in love
so in love
love love love love
so in love
You look so wonderful in your dress
I loved your hair like that
And in the moment I knew you best
