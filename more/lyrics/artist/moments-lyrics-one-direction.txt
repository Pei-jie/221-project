[Liam]
Shut the door, turn the lights off
I wanna be with you
I wanna feel your love
I wanna lay beside you
I cannot hide this even though I try
Heart beats harder
Time escapes me
Trembling hands touch skin
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face
[Harry]
If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time
[Chorus]
You know I'll be
Your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart
Is breathing for this
Moment in time
I'll find the words to say
Before you leave me today
[Niall]
Close the door
Throw the key
Don't wanna be reminded
Don't wanna be seen
Don't wanna be without you
My judgement is clouded
Like tonight's sky
[Louis]
Hands are silent
Voice is numb
Try to scream out my lungs
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face
{Harry]
If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time
[Chorus]
You know I'll be
Your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart
Is breathing for this
Moment in time
I'll find the words to say
Before you leave me today
[Zayn]
Flashes lights in my mind
Going back to the time
Playing games in the street
Kicking balls with my feet
There's a numb in my toes
Standing close to the edge
There's a pile of my clothes
At the end of your bed
As I feel myself fall
Make a joke of it all
[Chorus]
You know I'll be
Your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart
Is breathing for this
Moment in time
I'll find the words to say
Before you leave me today
You know I'll be
Your life, your voice, your reason to be
My love, my heart
Is breathing for this
Moment in time
I'll find the words to say
Before you leave me today
