[Chorus]
Suavemente, besame (RedOne!)
I'm ready to do whatever
If you take me away (Nayer!)
Suavemente, besame (Mohombi!)
I'll make you do whatever
If I take you away
[Pitbull]
Mister Worldwide
It's like deja vu, baby
Dale
[Nayer]
I know you crave it, and I can say that
You've been so patient and I've been waiting
For you to take it, and you can keep it
You say you need me, make me believe it
I wanna o-o-o
Can't let you go-o-o
Hey mami, damelo otra vez
Da-da-da-damelo otra vez
I wanna o-o-o
Can't let you go-o-o
Hey mami, damelo otra vez
Da-da-da-damelo otra vez
[Chorus]
Suavemente, besame
I'm ready to do whatever
If you take me away
Suavemente, besame
I'll make you do whatever
If I take you away
Suavemente, besame
I'm ready to do whatever
If you take me away
Suavemente, besame
I'll make you do whatever
If I take you away
[Pitbull]
The way you moving (suave)
Makes me say (suave)
Go 'head baby (suave)
Do it my babe (suave)
The way you moving (suave)
Makes me say (suave)
Go 'head baby (suave)
Do it my way (suave)
[Mohombi]
Tell me you want it so I can get it
Let's just be honest, you are the finest
Got you surrounded, baby surrender
Don't make me hunt you, I know you want to
I wanna o-o-o
Can't let you go-o-o
Hey mami, damelo otra vez
Da-da-da-damelo otra vez
I wanna o-o-o
Can't let you go-o-o
Hey mami, damelo otra vez
Da-da-da-damelo otra vez
[Chorus]
Suavemente, besame
I'm ready to do whatever
If you take me away
Suavemente, besame
I'll make you do whatever
If I take you away
Suavemente, besame
I'm ready to do whatever
If you take me away
Suavemente, besame
I'll make you do whatever
If I take you away
[Pitbull]
It's like deja vu, baby

Mohombi, Nayer, Pitbull, FIRE
This is revolution in music
And we cause riots
Yeah, just try us
Global domination
And everybody knows that me no liar
RedOne, have them sent a one billion year
And here's my wire
Armandito, tremenda gente
Tenemos siempre calle elegante y decente
Esta noche vamos hacer el amor
Ya tu sabe bebita suavemente
I want you to lose your mind, lose control
What before, lose it man
'Cause I know that to win big
You gotta be ready to lose it all, suave!
[Chorus]
Suavemente, besame
I'm ready to do whatever
If you take me away
Suavemente, besame
I'll make you do whatever
If I take you away
Suavemente, besame
I'm ready to do whatever
If you take me away
Suavemente, besame
I'll make you do whatever
If I take you away
