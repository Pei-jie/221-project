rock
In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard
Screaming at each other, screaming at each other like oh oh ohh
Can't take it any more oh oh oh
Like a tragedy, like a dark comedy
Laughing at each other, laughing at each other like oh oh oh
It isn't funny any more oh oh oh
I was the man who never lied
Never lied until today
But, I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday
I was the man who never lied, (oh oh oh)
I was the man who never lied, (oh oh oh)
Sometimes honesty is the worst policy
Happy ever after, happy ever after, let it go oh oh
You never need to know oh oh
I don't wanna be picking up all of these tiny little pieces, tiny little pieces, of your heart
Wont do it any more
I was the man who never lied
Never lied until today
But, I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday
I was the man who never lied, (oh oh oh)
I was the man who never lied, (oh oh oh)
I was the, I was the yeah, yeah, oh, oh
In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard
What am I doing, Hollywood Boulevard
In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard
Screaming at each other, scream
I was the man who never lied
Never lied until today
But, I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday
I was the man who never lied
Never lied until today
But, I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday
I was the man who never lied, (oh oh oh)
I was the man who never lied, (oh oh oh)
