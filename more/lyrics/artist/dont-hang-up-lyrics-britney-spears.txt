Baby, I'm lying all alone
A pillow, is all I have to hold
I can't feel you, God it isn't fair without you
I still wanna take you there
(Don't hang up)
It's just gettin' serious, damn
You're making me delirious
(Don't hang up)
'Til I'm finished with you
I'm not alone
(Don't hang up)
I'm not alone, I can still feel you
Even when I'm lonely and now I'm coming too
(Don't hang up)
I'm not alone, I can still feel you
Feel you when I'm lonely and now I'm coming too
Tell me, tell me what you see
(Tell me)
Feel me, feel me underneath
Slowly we began to breath
Hold on, hold on to your release
(Don't hang up)
It's just gettin' serious, damn
You're making me delirious
(Don't hang up)
'Til I'm finished with you
I'm not alone
(Don't hang up)
I'm not alone, I can still feel you
Even when I'm lonely and now I'm coming too
(Don't hang up)
I'm not alone, I can still feel you
Feel you when I'm lonely and now I'm coming too
You're far way, we will find away
Ooh baby now, let's make it right
Now close your eyes, damn
(Don't hang up)
It's just gettin' serious, damn
You're making me delirious
(Don't hang up)
'Til I'm finished with you
I'm not alone
(Don't hang up)
I'm not alone, I can still feel you
Even when I'm lonely and now I'm coming too
(Don't hang up)
I'm not alone, I can still feel you
Feel you when I'm lonely and now I'm coming too
(Don't hang up)
Do you feel me too?
Close your eyes
