Hey, can you hear me
I just wanted to let you know hmm
I hope you can hear what I write to you
how could I say goodbye to you
when I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life
that was inside of
you
I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the
whole fam you
came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man,
cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels plus racists full of
hatred in your own plant , 3 jobs in a day , rest in
life in you working but you were never stressed free
just locked in a cage slaving , they said they were
gold in the pavements but you came and saw the road to
amazement , broke your heart but still you were prone
to last and your sorrow was over fast , I hope your
listening right , I still think of you every Sunday no
one can top your chicken and rice, even through the
darkness times you held us all up cause your vision was
bright I knew your strength was your wisdom inside ,
you never let anyone see your heartache you just got
on with it , anyone tells me that they knew you said
you were beautiful and your words you would stand
strong with it. Cause they were like warmth on a winter
night but I was just too young to go on with it and
there something's I could try to do but it's an
impossible task for me to even try and say goodbye to
you , I couldn't do that , I owe my life to you .
And of the pieces of my soul because I need a sign I
hope this pain will heal in time you know I never want
to be alone ohh
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air and
will you think of me up there, can I say goodbye to
you? and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
or feel the chill of your warm embrace. Can I say
goodbye to you ohh
I think you phoney I was younger with the knowledge of
things that I know now I would be by your side when you
needed me instead of asking you 'Nan can I go out'
standing in a road with the gangs that I know now ,
everyone's missing you loads , Jessica's grown up ,
warren Lauren and Alex are fine and imp living with
hope , it's been a while since I've seen c and the
mouths I miss seeing and being a family and us agreeing
with smiles how it used to be as a child but as time
goes by the bridge seems longer family problems have
never been funny , in my heart the only one that dissed
me was Sonia she took all our inheritance money , left
the rest of us to pick up the pieces . i never forgive
the way she betrayed us , there ent a big enough reason
before I sell out my fam ill be giving up breathing ,
but I guess that everyone's different or should I say
no one's perfect she had happiness in front of her but
chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing . Since you
gone the foundations crumbled so building it back up is
my next step I got all the bricks and the cement but
it's hard when it's done I don't know what to expect,
so give me the strength that I need to perform this
task make it right I must do and I ask cause I trust
you it goes way beyond a song when I say I love you.
And of the pieces of my soul because I need a sign I
hope this pain will heal in time you know I never wanna
be aloneeeeee
I can see the stars as a cold the wind greets the air
and will you think of me up there can I say goodbye to
you? and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
or feel the chill of your warm embrace. Can I say
goodbye to you ohh
It's just for now so I should hush I'll never get
enough I'll see you when I see you but I miss you ohh
how I miss you , It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough I'll see you when I see you but I
miss you ohh how I miss you.
there ent enough words to describe how sorry I am for
the pain that I caused sorry for when I stuck up my
own blood we were young he said I was rape and he broad
and for the day police came to the door , I'm sorry for
being such a bad youth stealing from your purse and
making you mourn , I never been able to say this
before cause I've was so inconsiderate you love me
unconditionally and I took advantage of it like a idiot
not seeing the pure soul that I was living with I
really hope that you can forgive me , you going away
was a punishment but I won't let go I'm holding you
with me but I still fight the emotions within me
You see the stars as the cold wind greets the air and
will you think of me up there can I say goodbye to you
and paint the stains of the teardrops down your face
feel the chill of your warm embrace can I say goodbye
to you
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air and
will you think of me up there can I say goodbye to you
and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face or
feel the chill of your warm embrace. Can I say goodbye
to you ohh
