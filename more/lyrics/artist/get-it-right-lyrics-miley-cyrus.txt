[Verse 1]
Feel a surge coming over me
I feel it all around my thighs
And chills going up my legs
This is the worst coming out of me
When I can't tell, feel like I could die
And it sends chills up my spine
[Pre-Chorus]
You're sexy sexy
I got things I want to do to you
Make me make me
Make my tongue just go do-do-do
Flex it, flex it
Flex your muscles, and go through the roof
Arrest it rest it, cause it's just criminal
[Chorus]
I been laying in this bed all night long
Don't you think it's time to get it on
But we gotta get it right, we can't get it wrong
Don't you want to feel this fire before it's gone
[Verse 2]
I feel the thirst pouring out of me
The things that I wanna try
That echoes in my head
This is the first time I get to see
Things I've never seen in my life
You make flowers grow under my bed
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
For so long when you were gone
Ran right back home when I'm in your arms
You played my strings like my guitar
When I look in your eyes I see all the stars
Would you believe
I'm dancing in the mirror
I feel like I got no panties on
I wish that I could feel you
So hurry, hang up that damn phone
[Chorus]
[Outro]
I want it I want it, make it last forever
What you want all day
Just as long as it's you and I together, babe don't make me wait
