Hey, yeah yeah
I hate you, dont leave me
I feel like I cant breathe
Just hold me, dont touch me
And I want you to love me
But I need you to trust me
Stay with me, set me free
But I cant back down
No, I cant deny
That Im staying now
Cause I cant decide
Confused and scared
I am terrified of you
I admit Im in and out of my head
Dont listen to a single word Ive said
Just hear me out before you run away
Cause I cant take this pain
I hate you, dont leave me
I hate you, dont leave me
Cause I love when you kiss me
Im in pieces, you complete me
But I cant back down
No, I cant deny
That Im staying now
Cause I cant decide
Confused and scared
I am terrified of you
I admit Im in and out of my head
Dont listen to a single word Ive said
Just hear me out before you run away
Cause I cant take this pain, no
Im addicted to the madness
Im a daughter of the sadness
Ive been here too many times before
Been abandoned and Im scared now
I cant handle another fall out
Im fragile, just washed upon the shore
They forget me, dont see me
When they love me, they leave me
I admit Im in and out of my head
Dont listen to a single word Ive said
Just hear me out before you run away
Cause I cant take this pain
No, I cant take this pain
I hate you, dont leave me
I hate you, please love me
