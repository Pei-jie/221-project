I realized as I lay down to sleep
We havent spoke in weeks
So many things that Id like to know
Come have a talk with me
I need a sign, something I can see
Why all the mystery?
I try not to fall for make believe
But what is reality?
Where do we go? What do we know?
Life has to have a meaning
Show me the light, show me the way
Show that youre listening
Show me that you love me
Show me that you walk with me
Hopefully just above me
Heavens watching over me
Guess its funny how I say thanks to you
For all youve given me
And sometimes the price of what you gave to me
Is I cant stop questioning
Oh, God of love, peace and mercy
So why so much suffering?
I pray for the world, it gets worse to me
I wonder if youre listening
When people go, why do they go?
Why dont you choose me?
But someday I know that Im gonna go
I hope youre waiting for me
Show me that you love me
Show me that you walk with me
Hopefully just above me
Heavens watching over me
Show me
To show me
Maybe well talk some other night
Right now Ill take it easy
Wont spend my time waiting to die
Enjoy the life Im living
Show me that you love me
Show me that you walk with me
Hopefully just above me
Heavens watching over me
Show me that you love me
Show me that you walk with me
Hopefully just above me
Heavens watching over me
