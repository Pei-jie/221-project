Paramore
rock
We still live in the same town, well, don't we?
But I don't see you around anymore
I go to all the same places, not even a trace of you
Your days are numbered at 24
And I'm getting bored waiting 'round for you
We're not getting any younger
And I won't look back 'cause there's no use
It's time to move forward
I feel no sympathy, you lived inside a cave
You barely get by the rest of us
You're trying, there's no need to apologize
I've got no time for feeling sorry
I tried not to think of what might happen
When your reality it finally cuts through
Well, as for me, I got out and I'm on the road
The worst part is that this, this could be you
You know it too, you can't run from your shame
You're not getting any younger
Time keeps passing by but you waited awake
It's time to roll over
I feel no sympathy, you lived inside a cave
You barely get by the rest of us
You're trying, there's no need to apologize
I've got no time for feeling sorry
And all the best lies
They are told with fingers tied
So cross them tight, won't you promise me tonight?
If it's the last thing you do, you'll get out
I feel no sympathy, you lived inside a cave
You barely get by the rest of us
You're trying, there's no need to apologize
I've got no time, got no time
I feel no sympathy, you lived inside a cave
You barely get by the rest of us
You're trying, there's no need to apologize
Got no time
I've got no time for feeling sorry
I've got no time for feeling sorry
