I'm standin' on the bridge
I'm waitin' in the dark
I thought that you'd be here by now
There's nothing but the rain
No footsteps on the ground
I'm listening but there's no sound
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?
It's a damn cold night
I'm tryin' to figure out this life
Won't you, take me by the hand?
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I, I'm with you
I'm with you
Hmm hmm hmm
I'm looking for a place
I'm searching for a face
Is anybody here I know?
'Cause nothing's going right
And everything's a mess
And no one likes to be alone
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?
It's a damn cold night
I try to figure out this life
Won't you, take me by the hand?
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I, I'm with you
I'm with you
Yea yea
Oh, why is everything so confusing?
Maybe I'm just out of my mind
Yea eee yeah, yea eee yeah
Yea yee yea, yea eee yeah,yeah
It's a damn cold night
Tryin' to figure out this life
Won't you, take me by the hand?
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I, I'm with you, yea
I'm with you, yea
Take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I, I'm with you, yea
I'm with you, yea
Take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I, I'm with you, oh
I'm with you
I'm with you
