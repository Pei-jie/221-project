I wanna get you by yourself
Yeah, have you to myself
I don't need nobody else
Don't want nobody else
He's special, I know
His smile it glows
He's perfect it shows
Let's go
I've been staring at cha
And I could do it all night
You're lookin' like an angel
With that kind of body, needs a spotlight
Ain't nobody know your name
But lookin' like you do, could be famous
I could see us makin' ways
From the back of the club
To a bed in the shade now
Don't know who you are
But you look like a star
And everybody here be thinkin'
Who's that boy
Wanna take you home
And get cha all alone
And everybody here is thinkin'
Who's that boy
Oh he got me
No I've never seen
No one like him
Damn he's everything
Girls they want him
Guys they wanna be
Who's that boy
Who's that boy
Who, who, who, who, who....
You could say that I'm distracted
At how you got me so attracted
But boy I tell you what the fact is
Is no one else in this room
Lookin' like like you, you do
Ain't nobody know your name
But lookin' like you do, could be famous
I could see us makin' ways
From the back of the club
To a bed in the shade now
Don't know who you are
But you look like a star
And everybody here be thinkin'
Who's that boy
Wanna take you home
And get cha all alone
And everybody here is thinkin'
Who's that boy
Oh he got me
No I've never seen
No one like him
Damn he's everything
Girls they want him
Guys they wanna be
Who's that boy
Who's that boy
Who's that, who's that
Who's that, who's that
Who's that boy
Everybody in the club turn around sayin'
Who's that, who's that
Beautiful boy with them big brown eyes tell me
Who's that, who's that
I've got my eye on this boy
Can't get him off my mind
He's one of a kind
The cherry to my pie
I just want to get him close
Wanna make him mine
Come hold my hand
And dance away the night
Give me the green light
Kiss my lips
Who's that boy, watchin' my hips
I, I, I wanna know who you are
My name is DEV
And you can be my star
Don't know who you are
But you look like a star
And everybody here be thinkin'
Who's that boy
Wanna take you home
And get cha all alone
And everybody here is thinkin'
Who's that boy
Oh he got me
No I've never seen
No one like him
Damn he's everything
Girls they want him
Guys they wanna be
Who's that boy, who's that boy
Who's that boy, who's that boy
Who, who, who, who, who....
Who's that boy
Tell me who's that, who's that
Who's that
