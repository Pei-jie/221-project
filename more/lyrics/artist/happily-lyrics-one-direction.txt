[Harry]
You don't understand, you don't understand
What you do to me when you hold his hand
We were meant to be, but it's just a fade
Made it so we had to walk away
[Niall]
'Cause we're on fire, we're on on fire
We're on fire now
[Zayn]
Yeah, we're on fire, we are on fire
We're on fire now
(1, 2, 3)
[Chorus]
I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one who hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave so come on baby be with me so happily
[Liam]
It's 4am, and I know that you're with him
I wonder if he knows that I touched your skin
[Louis]
And if he feels my traces in your hair
I'm sorry love but I don't really care
[Niall]
'Cause we're on fire, we're on on fire
We're on fire now
[Zayn]
Yeah, we're on fire, we're on on fire
We're on fire now
(1, 2, 3)
[Chorus]
I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one who hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave so come on baby be with me so happily
[Liam]
So happily...
[Bridge]
(1, 2, 3, 4)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
We're on fire now
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
We're on fire now
(We're on fire)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
We're on fire now
[Chorus]
I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one who hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave so come on baby be with me so happily
I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one who hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave so come on baby be with me so happily
