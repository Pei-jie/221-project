rock
Now taste
All I ever needed
All I ever wanted
Too dumb on to surrender
She shakes
Like the morning railway
Checking me out
with someone on her shoulder
Her lamp
Flippers in her bedroom
She must feel as awkward
Whorehouse Arizona
And I go
Stand up to a giant
Say that I'm a fighter
Too drunk to remember
Too drunk to
Shake hands, my face
Is laying on the pavement
Tastin' something awful
I hate when that happens
She waves
Thinking that it's sexy
She must be plum crazy
I kinda think I like her
I kinda think I do
