I picture something is beautiful
It's full of life indeed and all blue
I've seen the sunset on the beach
Yeah, it makes me feel calm
And when I'm calm
I feel good
When I feel good I sing
And the joy it brings makes me feel good
And when I feel good, I sing
And the joy it brings
Come on alone
I know you really want to feel our song
We got some life to bring
We got some joy in this thing
So come on alone
I know you really want to feel our song
We got some life to bring
We got some joy in this thing
I see birds fly across the sky
Yeah, and everyone's heart fly together
Foot is flying and people smiling
There is no other way to feel good
I feel good
When I feel good I sing
And the joy it brings make it feel good
And when I feel good I sing
And the joy it brings
Come on alone
I know you really want to feel our song
We got some life to bring
We got some joy in this thing
So come on alone
I know you really want to feel our song
We got some life to bring
We got some joy in this thing
I see birds fly across the sky
Yeah, and everyone's heart fly together
Foot is flying and people smiling
There is no other way to feel good
I feel good
When I feel good I sing
And the joy it brings make it feel good
And when I feel good I sing
And the joy it brings
It brings me freedom
(Freedom)
Woah, got to get yourself to that freedom
Singing freedom
(Freedom)
Woah, you deserve your freedom
It's a smile you can keep in your heart
Freedom
Woah, all you need is at your freedom
It's a freedom
Singing freedom
(Freedom)
Let your children show your freedom
It's a freedom
Singing freedom
(Freedom)
Everybody wants that freedom
(Break it down)
Get you, get you, get you, get you
Get you, get you, get you that freedom
I want some freedom
Everybody knows that freedom
Don't forget your freedom, freedom
Come on alone
I know you really want to feel our song
We got some life to bring
We got some joy in this thing
So come on alone
I know you really want to feel our song
We got some life to bring
We got some joy in this thing
I see birds fly across the sky
Yeah, and everyone's heart fly together
Foot is flying and people smiling
There is no other way to feel good
