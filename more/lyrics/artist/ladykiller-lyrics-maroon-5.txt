Baby its not alright
second that you turn your back
She'll be outta sight.
Baby she'll break your heart
The second that you spend the night apart
How could you do it oh
How could you walk away from everything we made
How could you do it oh
You better watch yourself
I think that girls insane
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Its like a cheap thriller
She's such a ladykiller
Baby she'll eat you alive
As soon as she smells your blood in the water
You better run to survive
Before she makes you her latest slaughter
How could you do it
Oh, just come back to me
Baby I'm begging please
How could you do it
Oh she knows i love you still
Youre just her latest kill
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Its like a cheap thriller
Shes such a lady killer
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Its like a cheap thriller
Shes such a lady killer
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Its like a cheap thriller
Shes such a lady killer
