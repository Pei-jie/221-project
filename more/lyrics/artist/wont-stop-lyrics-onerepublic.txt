Now I stared at you from across the room
Until both my eyes were faded
I was in a rush, I was out of luck
Now I'm so glad I waited
Well you were almost there, almost mine, yeah
They say love ain't fair but I'm doing fine
'Cause I swear its you, I swear its you
I swear its you that Ive waited for
And I swear its you, I swear its you
I swear its you that my heart beats for
And it aint gonna stop, no it just wont stop
Now you are fire by night but when the morning light comes
Comfortable as rain on Sunday
And Im a lucky soul that holds your hand so tight
Hope you hear this one day
Dont fool yourself this is my truth
I swear its you, I swear its you
I swear its you that I've waited for
I swear its you, I swear its you
I swear its you that my heart beats for
And it aint gonna stop, it just wont stop
You take this hand, you take this heart
Stir my bones from a thousand miles apart
It feels so cold without you like it's ten shades of winter
And I need the sun
And I swear its you, I swear it's you
I swear it's you I waited for
I swear its you, I swear it's you
I swear its you that my heart beats for
I swear its you, I swear its you
I swear its you that Ive waited for
I swear it's you, I swear it's you
I swear its you that my heart beats for
And it aint gonna stop, it just wont stop
It just wont stop, it just won't stop no
I swear its you, I swear its you, oh yeah
