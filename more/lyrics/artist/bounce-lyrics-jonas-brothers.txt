Bounce, just bounce, let me see that body bounce
'Cause my rhymes are so fly, and my jeans are so tight
That I make these people bounce
Bounce, just bounce, let me see that body bounce
'Cause my rhymes are so fly, and my jeans are so tight
That I make these people bounce
Let me see that body bounce, baby
Well, let me see that body bounce
Let me see that body bounce, right
Yeah, man
Now I'm the kind of guy that likes to bounce
Now I'm the kind of gut that's gotta a pet mouse
I'm the kind of guy that likes to scream
Now all these other people wanna do it like me
So bounce, just bounce, let me see that body bounce
'Cause my rhymes are so fly, and my jeans are so tight
That I make these people bounce
Bounce, just bounce, let me see your body bounce
'Cause my rhymes are so fly, and my jeans are so tight
That I make these people bounce
Dance break
B to the O to the U to the N to the C to the E
Wait, I can't dance
That's okay, we'll show you how to bounce
B to the O to the U to the N to the C to the E
Wait, I can't dance
That's okay, we'll show you how to bounce
B is for bouncing, O is for opportunity
U is for unity, and N is for nutrition
C is for community, and E is for everybody
Do the bounce now, do the bounce
Let me see you bounce, just bounce
Let me see that body bounce
'Cause my rhymes are so fly, and my jeans are so tight
That I make these people bounce
Bounce, just bounce, let me see your body bounce
'Cause my rhymes are so fly, and my jeans are so tight
That I make these people bounce
Do the ham and cheese, do the ham and cheese
Do the chicken wing, do the chicken wing
Do the ham and cheese, do the ham and cheese
Do the chicken wing, do the chicken wing
Yeah man, just remember one thing
Keep on bouncing
I wanna thank MC B Love, D-Day Danger, KJ Chew
And my main man, Big Rob Productions
That's all we got for now, but keep it funky
And keep it bouncin' all the way to the top
