A words, just a word
'til you mean what you say
And love, isnt love
'til you give it away
We've all got to give
Yeah, something to give
To make a change
Send it on (send it on)
On and on (on and on)
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part (be a part)
Reach a heart (reach a heart)
Just one spark starts a fire
With one little action the chain reaction
Will never stop
Make us strong
Shine a light and send it on
Just Smile (just smile)
And the world (and the world)
Will smile
along with you..
That small act of love
Thats meant for one
Will become two
If we take the chances
to change circumstances
Imagine all we can do
Send it on (send it on)
On and on (on and on)
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part (be a part)
Reach a heart (reach a heart)
Just one spark starts a fire
With one little action the chain reaction
Will never stop
Make us strong
Shine a light and send it on
Send it on..
Theres power in all of the choices we make
So Im starting now theres not a moment to wait
A word, just a word
'til you mean what you say
And love, isnt love
'til you give it away
Send it on (send it on)
On and on (on and on)
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part (be a part)
Reach a heart (reach a heart)
Just one spark starts a fire
With one little action the chain reaction
We'll help it start
Make us strong
Shine a light and send it on
Send it on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part (be a part)
Reach a heart (reach a heart)
Just one spark starts a fire
With one little action the chain reaction
We'll help it start
Make us strong
Shine a light and send it on
Shine a light and send it on
Shine a light and send it on
