My pussy tastes like Pepsi Cola
My eyes are wide like cherry pies
I gots a taste for men who're older
It's always been, so it's no surprise
Harvey's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy
(I come alive, alive)
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby
Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife, and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, baby
Woah, ah yeah
I fall asleep in an American flag
I wear my diamonds on Skid Row
I pledge allegiance to my dad
For teachin' me everything he knows
Harvey's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy
(I come alive, alive)
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby, yeah
Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife, and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
Drugs, suck it up, like Vanilla Ice-ys
Don't treat me rough, treat me really nice-ys
Decorate my neck, diamantes icies
Why, come on, come on
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh yeah
Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife, and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
Come on baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
Come on, come on
Come on, baby
Come on, come on
Come on, baby
Woah oh, why
My pussy tastes like Pepsi Cola
