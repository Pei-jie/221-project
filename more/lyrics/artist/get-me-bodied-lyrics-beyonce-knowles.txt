B day
Mission one: I'm-a put this on
When he see me in this dress, I'm-a get me some, hey
Mission two: gotta make that call
Tell 'em get the bottles poppin' when they play my song, hey
Mission three: got my three best friends
Like we do it all the time, we gon' do it again, hey
Mission four: got the vintage Rolls
Drop a couple hundreds, tell 'em leave it at the door
I ain't worried, doing me tonight
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody
While y'all standin' on the wall
I'm the one tonight gettin' bodied
Gettin' bodied (gettin' bodied)
Gettin' bodied (gettin' bodied)
Gettin' bodied (I'm the only one tonight gettin' bodied)
Gettin' bodied
If you want my body (gettin' bodied)
Won't you get me bodied? (gettin' bodied)
If you want my body (I'm the only one tonight gettin' bodied)
Won't you get me bodied?
Can you get me bodied?
I wanna be myself tonight
Can you get me bodied?
I wanna be myself tonight
Don't you see my body?
I wanna let it out tonight
Wanna party, wanna dance, wanna be myself tonight
Mission five: skip to the front of the line
Let me fix my hair 'fore I go inside
Mission six: gotta check these chicks
'Cause you know they gon' block when I take these flicks
Mission seven: gotta make my rounds
Givin' eyes to the guys; now I think I found him
Mission eight: while we're conversating, we can skip small talk
Let's get right to the chase
I ain't worried, doing me tonight
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody
While y'all standin' on the wall
I'm the one tonight gettin' bodied
Gettin' bodied (gettin' bodied)
Gettin' bodied (gettin' bodied)
Gettin' bodied (I'm the only one tonight gettin' bodied)
Gettin' bodied
If you want my body (gettin' bodied)
Won't you get me bodied? (gettin' bodied)
If you want my body (I'm the only one tonight gettin' bodied)
Won't you get me bodied?
You see my body?
I gotta know; I'd like to know if you can get me bodied
I'm kinda tight; I'm feelin' right; I'd like to see somebody
I wanna let it out tonight
Wanna dance, wanna party, wanna be myself tonight
Can you get me bodied?
I wanna be myself tonight
Can you get me bodied?
I wanna be myself tonight
Don't you see my body?
I wanna let it out tonight
Wanna party, wanna dance, wanna be myself tonight
Baby, all I want
Is to let it go
Ain't no worries, no
We can dance all night
Get me bodied
That means come closer to me
While we grind to the beat
And your body is touchin' me
All I need
Is to let it be
Ain't no worries, no
Boy, dance with me
Feel my body
Don't stop; just come closer to me
While we grind to the beat
And your body is touchin' my body
Gettin' bodied
Ain't no shame 'cause I gotta get mine
I swing my hair and kick off my shoes
Come here, boy, and let me work on you
I ain't worried, doing me tonight
A little sweat ain't never hurt nobody
While y'all standin' on the wall
I'm the one tonight gettin' bodied
Gettin' bodied (gettin' bodied)
Gettin' bodied (gettin' bodied)
Gettin' bodied (I'm the only one tonight gettin' bodied)
Gettin' bodied
If you want my body (gettin' bodied)
Won't you get me bodied? (gettin' bodied)
If you want my body (I'm the only one tonight gettin' bodied)
Won't you get me bodied?
