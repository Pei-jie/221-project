Paramore
rock
I've got a life out there somewhere, it's waiting
Lined with palmtrees and only new faces
If I could look past the present and get there
Well baby it's worth a shot
Just enough time to plan an escape route
I put my map on the wall in the basement
Not quite a victory to run from your problems
But it's the only plan that I got
It's the only plan that I got
And if you try to find me now (oh, oh-oh, oh)
I'm in all the echoes that have faded out
So, I'm moving on 'cause I just want to feel for once that I belong
And that's what's going on, that's what's going on
Cross the state line and called out a warning
Not too long, now I'll breathe California
Paid my dues and I'll try to be loyal
But now I'm done with all that
Where I'm going is everyone's story
We want you left, we're left to start over
It's not a question of who are we really
It's who we wanna be
And if you try to find me now (oh, oh-oh, oh)
I'm in all the echoes that have faded out
So, I'm moving on 'cause I just want to feel for once that I belong
And thats what's going on
All that's in between, a brand new life and I this time
But time has not been kind
It's not been kind to me, its winding backwards
Time has not been kind, its crawling by so slowly!
And if you try to find me now (oh, oh-oh, oh)
I'm in all the echoes that have faded out
So, I'm moving on 'cause I just want to feel for once that I belong
And that's what's going on
And if you try to find me now (oh, oh-oh, oh)
I'm in all the echoes that have faded out
So, I'm moving on 'cause I just want to feel for once that I belong
And that's what's going on
