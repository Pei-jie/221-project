Girl, you better
Stop, stop playin'
Bitch, what'cha waitin' for?
Get your ass on the floor
Girl, you better
Stop, stop playin'
Bitch, what'cha waitin' for?
Get your ass on the floor
You know the night was good
When you wake up in the morning
With a cloudy piss, you know how I do
Gimme the vodka skip the Cris
I'm at the bar feelin' like 50 takin' like 9 shots
I got like 9 broads takin' 'em with me why stop
Now I'm bouncin' from broad to broad
This thing is thick from wall to wall
I've never read the book
But its like I mastered the art of war
So if anybody thinks they can take advantage
'Cuz I've had a couple of drinks think again
I'll have you like Kanye West
With a brand new jaw and a metal chin
Girl, you better
Stop, stop playin'
Bitch, what'cha waitin' for?
Get your ass on the floor
Girl, you better
Stop, stop playin'
Bitch, what'cha waitin' for?
Get your ass on the floor
Excuse me I'm takin' over, I'm sick like Ebola
I don't know what they told ya but bitch this Chico's a soldier
Get the crip and roll up or drop the E and roll out
Most of these busta's fold up when it's time to thug out
I'mma take it to the club
Where them freaks be takin' it off and backin' it up
I'mma make ya so hot as soon as these mami's walk in
They ready to fuck
Every, body, listen, closely
'Cuz I'mma do what's never been done
The games been fucked
But it's never been sprung
Girl, you better
Stop, stop playin'
Bitch, what'cha waitin' for?
Get your ass on the floor
Girl, you better
Stop, stop playin'
Bitch, what'cha waitin' for?
Get your ass on the floor
Get your ass on the floor
Get your ass on the floor
Get your ass on the floor
Get your ass on the floor
Girl
Stop, stop playin'
Bitch, what'cha waitin' for?
Get your ass on the floor
Girl
Stop, stop playin'
Bitch, what'cha waitin' for?
Get your ass on the floor
