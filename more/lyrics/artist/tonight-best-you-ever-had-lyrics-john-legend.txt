Ain't this what you came for?
Don't you wish you came more?
Girl, what you playing for? Ah, come on
Come on, let me kiss that
Oh, I know you miss that
What's wrong? Let me fix that, twist that
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight, you need that, tonight, believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be the best you ever had
I hit you with the best stroke,
freestyle and the breast stroke
'Til you're blowing cigarette smoke
And now the bed's broke
So what we gonna do now?
F**k it, round two now
Work it out then we cool down, cool down
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight, you need that, tonight, believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be the best you ever had
(Give me a little bit of that light-skinned love)
Listen, you ain't even gotta text me
Knowing me and you, we got that mental telepathy
Meet me up in the spot, I'll be sendin' over the chauffeur
Rich nigga bread stay poppin' up like a toaster
Nobody come close to me and you together
Step under my umbrella, we'll make it through any weather
Except when I make it storm, sex in the greatest form
Hibernate under my body, I keep it warmer than a chinchilla
She know I beat it up like the thriller in Manila
Flyin' my private jet to villas in Anguilla
Then throw you on the grill 'cause seven days a week you're my five course meal, forreal
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight, you need that, tonight, believe that
Tonight, I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be (I'll be) the best you ever had
