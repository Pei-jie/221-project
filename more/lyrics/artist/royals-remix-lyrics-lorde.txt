Lorde
alternative
[Verse 1: Lorde]
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the
Movies
And I'm not proud of my address, in the torn up town
No post code
Envy
[Pre-Hook: Lorde]
But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
[Hook: Lorde]
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule...)
Let me live that fantasy
[Interlude: The Weeknd]
Ooooh, oooooh, ooooh
[Verse 2: Lorde & The Weeknd]
My friends and I we've cracked the code (cracked the code, cracked the code)
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us, knows us kno-kno-kno-know
That we're fine with this, with this
We didn't come from money, noooo baby
[Pre-Hook: Lorde & The Weeknd]
But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, no we don't, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, oh no, we aren't caught up in your love affair
[Hook: Lorde]
[Outro: The Weeknd]
Oooooh, ooooh, ooooh
Oooooh, ooooh, ooooh
