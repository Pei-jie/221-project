rock
Why are there so many
Songs about rainbows
And what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions
But only illusions
Rainbows have nothing to hide
What's, what's so amazing
That it keeps us star gazing
And what do they think we might see
Oh, someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me
Have you been half asleep
And have you heard the voices?
Well, I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound
That calls the young sailors?
Their voice might be one and the same
I've heard it too many
Many times to ignore it
And I think it might be oh
Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me
