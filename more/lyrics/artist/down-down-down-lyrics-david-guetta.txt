Come On Lets Drink It Up
And We Dont Go All Night
And We Aint Stop Untill The Sunlight Touch The Ground
The Music Is Getting Loud I Cant Believe It Right
We Jumpin Jumpin Like Its Going Not To Stop
Chorus:
Down Down Down Feel Like The Club Is Burning Down
Down Down Down Down
Down Down Down Down
Down Down Down Feel Like The Club Is Burning Down
Down Down Down Down
Down Down Down Down
First Cal For Shot
Wont Be No Last
My Hands Got Lost I Found Em On Her Ass
She Kissing Her And Her Touching Me
Must Be The Base This Beat Is Breaking Glass
Moving More Baby Pour All Your Love On Me
Dj Go Dont Stop It No
She Taking Up The Club
Come On Lets Drink It Up
And We Dont Go All Night
And We Aint Stop Untill The Sunlight Touch The Ground
The Music Is Getting Loud I Cant Believe It Right
We Jumpin Jumpin Like Its Going Not To Stop
Chorus:
Down Down Down Feel Like The Club Is Burning Down
Down Down Down Down
Down Down Down Down
Down Down Down Feel Like The Club Is Burning Down
Down Down Down Down
Down Down Down Down
Lets Go Too Far
No Turning Back
With Some Crazy Shit
Live Tonight Like Its Our Last
Give Up Control
No Need For That
Yes A Stranger
Tomorrow Will Be No Regrets ..
Moving More Baby Pour All Your Love On Me
Dj Go Dont Stop It No
She Taking Up The Club
