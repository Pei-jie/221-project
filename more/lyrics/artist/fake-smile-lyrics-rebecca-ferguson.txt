Well, I'm not gonna lie
Doesn't work I've tried
I've choked up the bitterness with wine
Calling him up, fully drunk
But he declines count on my blessings
And now I'm down to none
He took the piss because I let him
Yeah, I was good while I was fun
Put on your fake smile
And wipe away your real tears
What's real anyway?
What's real anyway?
Put on that short skirt
And show him what he'll miss
It's not real anyway
It's not real anyway
So I'm not getting old
Maybe the time and drunk
But I thought we were getting better
And he just smiles as he tells me
I'm not the one, this film he's directing
All his feelings are missing
And I'm saying sorry on the fault
For all the awful things that I have done
Put on your fake smile
And wipe away your real tears
What's real anyway?
What's real anyway?
Put on that short skirt
And show him what he'll miss
It's not real anyway
It's not real anyway
Just when it's over
And not getting older
After all my time
That's smile is real
As real as is
Put on your fake smile
And wipe away your real tears
What's real anyway?
What's real anyway?
Put on that short skirt
And show him what he'll miss
We've all done it anyway
Let's be real anyway
