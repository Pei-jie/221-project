nity called your name and
You said that you didn't feel the same way I felt for you.
Hey You said we'd grow old, and we'd start us a family
And, you said we'd be in love, we'd live ever after happily
And, got a call from fortune and fame
They said that they wanna change your name
But I care for you
Cause I still hear your voice
Said I still hear your voice
Now think about the lie that you fell in
Now it feels like you're about to give in
Cause I still hear your voice, on my radio
On my radio
