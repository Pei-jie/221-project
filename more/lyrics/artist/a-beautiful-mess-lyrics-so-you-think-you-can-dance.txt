So%20You%20Think%20You%20Can%20Dance
other
Youve got the best of both worlds
Youre the kind of girl who can take down a man
And lift him back up again
You are strong but youre needy, humble but youre greedy
Based on your body language and shorty cursive Ive been reading
Youre style is quite selective but your mind is rather reckless
Well, I guess it just suggests that this is just what happiness is
Hey, what a beautiful mess this is
Its like picking up trash in dresses
Well, it kind of hurts when the kind of words you write
And kind of turn themselves into knives
And dont mind my nerve you can call it fiction
'Cause I like being submerged in your contradictions, dear
'Cause here we are, here we are
Although you were biased I love your advice
Your comebacks theyre quick and probably
Have to do with your insecurities
Theres no shame in being crazy depending on how you take these
Words they're paraphrasing this relationship were staging
And its a beautiful mess, yes, it is
Its like we're picking up trash in dresses
Well, it kind of hurts when the kind of words you say
Kind of turn themselves into blades
And the kind and courteous is a life Ive heard
But its nice to say that we played in the dirt
'Cause here, here we are, here we are
Here we are, here we are
Here we are, here we are
Here we are, here we are
Here we are, we're still here
And what a beautiful mess this is
Its like taking a guess when the only answer is yes
And through timeless words and priceless pictures
Well fly like birds not of this earth
And tides they turn and hearts disfigure
But thats no concern when were wounded together
And we tore our dresses and stained our shirts
But it's nice today, oh, the wait was so worth it
