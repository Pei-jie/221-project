I tried to paint you a picture
The colors were all wrong
Black and white didn't fit you
And all along
You were shaded with patience
Your strokes of everything
That I need just to make it,
But I can see
Lord knows I failed you time and again,
But you and me are alright
We won't say our goodbyes
You know its better that way
We wont break, we wont die
Its just a moment of change
All we are, all we are
Is everything that's right
All we need, all we need
A lover's alibi, Yeah.
I walked a minute in your shoes
They never would have fit
I figured there's nothing to lose
I need to get
Some perspective on these words
Before I write them down
You're an island and my ship
Has run aground
Lord knows I failed you time and again,
But you and me are alright, Yeah
We won't say our goodbyes
You know its better that way
We wont break, we wont die
Its just a moment of change
All we are, all we are
Is everything that's right
All we need, all we need
A lover's alibi
Every single day that I can breathe
You changed my philosophy
I'm never gonna let you pass me by
So don't say your goodbyes
You know it's better that way
We wont break, we wont die
Its just a moment of change
Yeah, ooh, ooh.
So don't say your goodbyes
You know it's better that way
We wont break, we wont die
Its just a moment of change
All we are, all we are
Is everything that's right
All we need, all we need
A lover's alibi, yeah, ooh, ooh.
So dont say your goodbyes
You know it's better...
We wont break, we wont die
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-whoa, ahh, ahh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Won't die, wont die this time
Won't die, won't die, oh....)
