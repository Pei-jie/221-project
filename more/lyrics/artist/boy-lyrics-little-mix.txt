Do you remember what he said?
I do, he told you he'll never ever hurt you
Oh, here we go again
Another break-up, make-up
When you gonna wake up?
I'm gon' be the one to call him out
Look how many times he let you down
When he's gonna learn to be a real ma-a-aaan?
im gonna be the one to say you're beautiful
One more word he never said at all
I'm just saying
You need to go forget that boy, forget that boy
You know a bad boy ain't good enough for you
You're holding back tears in your eyes
That boy wanna fight, but I never see him fighting for you
He'll never realize what he's got until it's gone
And he'll lose you forever
Girl, you'll be alright, forget that boy
Girl, don't you know you set the tone
I'll make you stop that, fight back
He won't get away with that
Look, who's ringing up your phone
You wanna call back, leave that
Ain't nobody got time for that
It's funny how the tables turn
When he's the one who left the home
Find your own real man and
Go forget that boy, forget that boy
You know a bad boy ain't good enough for you
You're holding back tears in your eyes
That boy wanna fight, but I never see him fighting for you
He'll never realize what he's got untl it's gone
And he'll lose you forever
Girl, you'll be alright, forget that boy
See what you're worth girl, look what you got
He knows you're out of his league, if he likes it or not
I know what you're worth girl, you know what you got
He knows you're out of his league, if he likes it or not
Oh, oh, yeah
Forget that boy, forget that boy
You know that a bad boy ain't good enough for you
You're holding back tears in your eyes
That boy wanna fight, but I never see him fighting for you
He'll never realize what he's got until it's gone
And he'll lose you forever
Girl, you'll be alright, forget that boy
That boy, that boy
I know what you're worth girl, look what you got
He knows you're out of his league, if he likes it or not
Girl, you'll be alright, forget that boy
