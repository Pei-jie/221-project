Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
Let your heart be light.
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight.
Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
Make the Yule-tide gay.
From now on our troubles will be miles away.
Here we are as in olden days,
Happy golden days of yore.
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more.
Through the years we all will be together if the fates allow.
Until then, well just have tomorrow through, somehow.
Here we are as in olden days,
Happy golden days of yore.
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more.
Someday soon we all will be together, if the fates allow.
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.
And have yourself a merry little Christmas, now.
