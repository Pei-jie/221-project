Yeah yeah yeah mmm
This isn't holding hands in the play ground any more
Just be a man, make a decision, walk out the door
Well, all of your feeling's gone
When did it all go wrong
in your mind oh!
So run baby run run run ...
You know that I ain't the one
Just go away and have some fun
Just run baby run run run
Go back home.
Why can't you see the truth when is right in front of you
You don't love me anymore so I guess we're through
You've changed and I'm not waiting here
I'm over tears so please don't move.
Chorus:
Run baby run run run
You know that I ain't the one
Just go away and have some fun
Just run baby run run run.
You only get one life so why waste it on fights?
demons and old lies do as right and I'll be ok
Chorus:
So run baby run run run
You know that I ain't the one
Just go away and have some fun
Just run baby run run run
Yeah uhh
run run run run circle circle circle
Just run baby run
run run run run circle circle circle
2 x Chorus:
Yeah baby run run run
You know that I ain't the one
Just go away and have some fun
Just run baby run run run.
Just run.
