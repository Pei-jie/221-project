pop
Free my mind, ARTPOP
You make my heart stop
Come to me, in all your glamour, and cruelty
Just do the thing that you do
And I'll undress you
Give it tight, sometimes the simplest move is right
The melody that you choose
Can rescue you?
A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My artpop could mean anything
[Chorus]
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP
Come to me, without your sub-techs and fantasy
Just do the thing that you do
For my love is you
Love is fly, I've flown my beaches with lover's side
Look at the bad that you choose
Can profit you
A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My artpop could mean anything
Could try to sell you out or I
Could show you all the reasons why
my artpop could mean anything
[Chorus]
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP
[Chorus]
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP
Brushes with darkness wont help you create
your destiny of self but Artpop could mean anything
Anything
I tried to sell myself, but I am really laughing
Because I just love the music not the bling
Music not the bling
[Chorus]
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP
[Chorus]
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
We could, we could, belong together (artpop)
ARTPOP, ARTPOP
Free my mind, ARTPOP
You make my heart stop
