Pink
pop
Screw fear, its contagious
Infecting everything
It makes me do such stupid, stupid stuff
I say things I never mean
What exactly do I think?
Who am I protecting?
If I fall itll blow up in my face
Thats just crazy
Im delicate
Im sensitive
Please try to be more careful
Youre mean
Youre a lunatic
Lets try to make this fun again
Its only love, give it away
(Its only love)
Youll probably get it back again
(Its only love)
Its simple, its a silly thing
Throw it away like a boomerang
I wish we all could lighten up
Its only love, not a time bomb
Im tired from last nights fight
I wish I hadnt started it
I hate when my fear speaks for me
It makes me nasty
I thought we could start again
Go back to the days when we felt like friends
Its all too serious for me
And I know Im guilty
Matchsticks and poison
Thats what I add to the fire
My dear, Im frozen
Turned from a saint to a liar
Its only love, give it away
(Its only love)
Youll probably get it back again
(Its only love)
Its simple, its a silly thing
Throw it away like a boomerang
I wish we all could lighten up
Its only love not a time bomb
I dont want to be precious
I dont want to feel stress
Life is for the living, but not a living hell
So take it
Take this
Oh, you can have all of me
Take it
Take this
Here, you can have everything
I dont want to be flawless
When I go I want the cuts to show
So take it
Take this
Oh, you can have all of me
Break it
Take it
Oh, f**k it, have everything
Its only love, give it away
(Its only love)
Youll probably get it back again
(Its only love)
Its simple, its a silly thing
Throw it away like a boomerang
I wish we all could lighten up
Its only love not a time bomb
(Its only love)
(Its only love)
Its simple, its a silly thing
Throw it away like a boomerang
I wish we all could lighten up
Its only love not a time bomb
