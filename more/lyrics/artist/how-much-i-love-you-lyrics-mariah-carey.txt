Oh baby, I don't think you know
Just just how much I love you
Have you ever felt lonely
When you know you gotta leave me?
That's how much I love
Oh baby, I don't think you know
Just just how much I love you
Have you ever felt lonely
When you know you gotta leave me?
That's how much I love
The way I feel for you, I can't describe
It's almost too intense to verbalize
Essentially you're all I'm living for
But basically each day
I need you more and more
Have you ever felt so enamored, baby?
That's how much I love you
All I need in this life, you see
Is me and my boyfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Have you ever felt lost
When you know you gotta leave me?
That's how much I love you
Love is yours and mine till the very end
Just me and my boyfriend
Don't underestimate the love in me
It's obvious these feelings run so deep
I fall apart for you day after day
Nobody else could ever take your place
Have you ever felt so enamored, baby?
That's how much I love you
All I need in this life, you see
Is me and my boyfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Have you ever felt lost
When you know you gotta leave me?
That's how much I love you
Love is yours and mine till the very end
Just me and my boyfriend
You don't gotta waste your time and worry
You don't gotta look for reassurance
'Cause clearly you're the only one
That's getting this and
Sugar, I don't need nobody else but you
And honey, I ain't letting go too soon
Because I can't get enough
Why you asking how much?
It's more than you can handle baby
Have you ever felt so enamored, baby?
That's how much I love you
All I need in this life, you see
Is me and my boyfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Have you ever felt lost
When you know you gotta leave me?
That's how much I love you
Love is yours and mine till the very end
Just me and my boyfriend
Have you ever felt so enamored, baby?
That's how much I love you
All I need in this life, you see
Is me and my boyfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Have you ever felt lost
When you know you gotta leave me?
That's how much I love you
Love is yours and mine till the very end
Just me and my boyfriend
Have you ever felt so enamored, baby?
That's how much I love you
All I need in this life, you see
Is me and my boyfriend
(Me and my girlfriend)
Have you ever felt lost
When you know you gotta leave me?
That's how much I love you
Love is yours and mine till the very end
Just me and my boyfriend
