Take a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do
I walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And didn't know how nice that is
But I do
And you throw your head back laughing
Like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny
Cause he never did
And I've been spending the last 8 months
Thinking all love ever does is
Break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again
You say you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do
But you throw your head back laughing
Like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny
Cause he never did
And I've been spending the last 8 months
Thinking all love ever does is
Break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again
And we walk down the block to my car
I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches
Every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that
For the first time
What's past is past
Cause you throw your head back laughing
Like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny
Cause he never did
And I've been spending the last 8 months
Thinking all love ever does is
Break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again
