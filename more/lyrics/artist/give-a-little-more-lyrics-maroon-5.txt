Now you've been bad, and it goes on and on and on
'Til you come home, babe, 'til you come home
Beauty's past, the poison you've learned to love is gone
I'm all alone baby, I'm all alone
I'm waiting for something, always waiting
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change
And then I give a little more, ooh, babe
Give a little more, ooh, babe
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you, baby
Get a little more from you, baby
You were wrong for turning me on
And on and on
And on and on
You make it so hard
I'm waiting for something, always waiting
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change
And then I give a little more, ooh, babe
Give a little more, ooh, babe
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you, baby
Get a little more from you, baby
I have no defense
I know you're gonna get me in the end
And I cannot pretend
I never wanna feel this way again
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you, baby
Get a little more from you, baby
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you, baby
Get a little more from you, baby
