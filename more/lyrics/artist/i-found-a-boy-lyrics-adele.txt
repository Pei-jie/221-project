I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true!
I fall short each time,
Every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer, closer and near,
Like a fool for fire I fall, with my pride and all!
Like a bomb before explosion,
Ticking by your call
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed
And I'm just a child who longs on her knees.
[Chorus:]
But I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried,
And let yourself down!
Look how you want me now but I don't need you!
So, you thought that I crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you
Crawling back to me
To whisper 'will you leave your man? '
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me.
I won't stand by you!
[Chorus:]
Cause I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried
And let yourself down!
Look how you want me now but I don't need you!
I ain't yours for no taking,
You must be mistaken,
I could never look into your eyes, and stand for wrong
And ignore who I
[Chorus:]
Well I found a boy that loves me more,
Than you ever me did before.
So stand beside the river you cried
And let yourself down!
Look how you want me now but I don't need you!
