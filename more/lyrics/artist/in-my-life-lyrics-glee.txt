There are places I remember
All my life, though some have change
Some forever not for better
Some have gone, and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one who compares with you
And these memories lose their meanings
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more
(Instrumental)
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life, I love you more
