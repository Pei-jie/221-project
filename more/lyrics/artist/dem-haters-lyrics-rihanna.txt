I'm not concerned with people
Who prey on the wealth of their fellow man
'Cause they only want to know you, enroll you
Only for the things ya had, I just think it's so sad
Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down, down
See them try to mess to hurt you and work you
Anything to bring ya down, down
They keep evil thoughts in their hearts
What you don't know
You can't let them knock your hustle
Not letting them know how much you struggle
They turn green with envy when you're on top
And dem heart is full with strife
Their by gonna try to take your life
Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down, down
See them try to mess to hurt you and work you
Anything to bring ya down, down
Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down, down
See them try to mess to hurt you and work you
Anything to bring ya down, down
Ya, know they talk about ya and they tell the lies
Don't be fooled you betta recognize
They not there for you, they don't care for you
Trust me 'cuz I know it's true
Ya know they smile in your face and make ya think they down
Then they turn against you when you're not around
It's just jealousy and dishonesty
So, hold on to your sanity
Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down, down
See them try to mess to hurt you and work you
Anything to bring ya down, down
Get dem haters out your circle
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down, down
See them try to mess to hurt you and work you
Anything to bring ya down, down
Ya, know they talk about ya and they tell the lies
Don't be fooled you betta recognize
They not there for you, they don't care for you
Trust me 'cuz I know it's true
Ya know they smile in your face and make ya think they down
Then they turn against you when you're not around
It's just jealousy and dishonesty
So hold on to your sanity
