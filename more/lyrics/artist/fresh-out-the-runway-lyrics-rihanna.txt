love it, then come and get it
I know that you're f*cking with it
You see me, you like it, huh?
Heel givenchy, huh?
You love it then play it back
Plus where the 40 at
I'm f*cking yo cheap thrill on top of my 50 mil
He eating in the cake killa, He on it but don't kill her
My jewelers are diamond roller
My rock....chinchilla
Some more raw fun, I'm rolling like rock stars
I got 50 motherf*ckers in my watch with my bandz out
