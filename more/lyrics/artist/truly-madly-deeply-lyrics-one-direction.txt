[Liam:]
Am I asleep am I awake or somewhere in between
I cant believe that you are here and lying next to me
Or did I dream that we were perfectly intertwined
Like branches on a tree, or twigs caught on a vine
[Niall:]
Like all those days and weeks and months I tried to steal a kiss
And all those sleepless nights and daydreams where I pictured this
Im just the underdog who finally got the girl
And I am not ashamed to tell it to the world!
[Harry & Louis:]
Truly, madly, deeply I am
Foolishly, completely falling
And somehow you kicked all my walls in
So baby say you'll always keep me
Truly, madly, crazy, deeply in love with you
In love with you
[Liam:]
Should I put coffee and granola on a tray in bed
And wake you up with all the words that I still havent said
And tender touches just to show you how I feel
Or should I act so cool, like it was no big deal
[Zayn:]
Wish I could freeze this moment in a frame and stay like this
or put this day back on replay and keep reliving it
Cause heres the tragic truth, if you dont feel the same
My heart would fall apart if someone said your name
[Harry & Louis]
Truly, madly, deeply I am
Foolishly, completely falling
And somehow you kicked all my walls in
So baby say you'll always keep me
Truly, madly, crazy, deeply in love with you
[Louis:]
I hope Im not a casualty
I hope you wont get up and leave
Might not mean that much to you
But to me its everything
Everything
[All:]
Truly, madly, deeply I am
Foolishly, completely falling
And somehow you kicked all my walls in
So baby say you'll always keep me
Truly, madly, crazy, deeply in love (in love)
With you (with you)
In love (in love)
With you (with you)
In love (in love)
With you (with you)
