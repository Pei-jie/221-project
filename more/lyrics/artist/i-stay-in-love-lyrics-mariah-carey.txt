Why do I stay
Why do I stay in love?
Oh, baby
Baby, I stay in love with you
Dying inside 'cause I can't stand it
Make or break up, can't take this madness
We don't even really know why
All I know is, baby, I try and try so hard to keep our love alive
If you don't know me at this point
Then I highly doubt you ever will
I really need you to give me
That unconditional love I used to feel
It's no mistaking, we're just erasing from our hearts and minds
And I know we said let go but I kept on hanging on
Inside I know it's over, you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't nothing that I can do
Baby, I stay in love with you
And I keep on telling myself that you'll come back around
And I try to front like, "Oh well," each time you let me down
See I can't get over you now no matter what I do
But baby, baby, I stay in love with you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Baby, I stay in love with you
It cuts so deep, it hurts down to my soul
My friends tell me I ain't the same no more
We still need each other when we stumble and fall
How we gon' act like what we had, ain't nothing at all now
Hey, what I wanna do is ride shotgun next to you
With the top down like we used to hit the block, proud in the SUV
We both know our heart is breaking
Can we learn from our mistakes?
I can't last one moment alone, now go I know
We said let go but I kept on hanging on
Inside I know it's over, you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't nothing that I can do
Baby, I stay in love with you
And I keep on telling myself that you'll come back around
And I try to front like "Oh well," each time you let me down
See I can't get over you now no matter what I do
But baby, baby, I stay in love with you
We said let go but I kept on hanging on
Inside I know it's over, you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't nothing that I can do
Baby, I stay in love with you
And I keep on telling myself that you'll come back around
And I try to front like, "Oh well," each time you let me down
See I can't get over you now no matter what I do
But baby, baby, I stay in love with you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
I stay in love with you
