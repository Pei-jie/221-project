i remember tears steaming down your face
when i said i never let you go,
when all those shadows almost killed your light
i remember you said "don't leave me alone"
but all that's dead and gone and passed tonight
just close your eyes
the sun is going down
you'll be alright
no one can hurt you now
come morning light
you and i'll be safe and sound
don't you dare look out your window
darling everything's on fire
the war outside our door keeps ranging on
curled up to this lullaby
even when the music's gone
gone- -
just close your eyes
the sun is going down
you'll be alright
no one can hurt you now
come morning light
you and i'll be safe and sound
Ooh,ooh,oh,oh,oh,oh
Ooh,ooh,oh,oh,oh
just close your eyes
you'll be alright
come morning light,
you and i'll be safe and sound
Ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,
Ooh,ooh,ooh,ooh,
Ooh,ooh,ooh
Oohhh
