You were perfect
I was unpredictable
It was more than worth it
But not too sensible
Young and foolish
Seemed to be the way
I was stupid
To think that I could stay
(Oh, oh)
To think that I could stay
Goodbye my friend, hello heartache
It's not the end, it's not the same
Wish it didn't have to be this way, but
You will always be the world to me love
Goodbye my friend, hello heartache
La la la la la la la la
Hello heartache
La la la la la la la la
I was champagne
You were Jameson
Every bad thing, we did was so much, fun
I've seen your best side
You got to see my worst
It's not the first time
But this one really hurts
(Oh, oh)
Yeah this one's gonna, it hurts
Goodbye my friend, hello heartache
It's not the end, it's not the same
Wish it didn't have to be this way, but
You will always mean the world to me love
Goodbye my friend, hello heartache
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Do you know, do you get
It's just goodbye, it's not the end
Do you know, do you get
It's just goodbye, it's not the end
Goodbye my friend, hello heartache
It's not the end, it's not the same
Wish it didn't have to be this way, but
You will always mean the world to me love
Goodbye my friend, hello heartache
La la la la la la la la
Hello heartache
La la la la la la la la
Wish it didn't have to be this way, but
You will always mean the world to me love
Goodbye my friend, hello heartache
La la la la la la la
