I know this isn't what I wanted
I never thought it come this far
Just thinking back to where we started
And how we lost all that we are
We were young and times were easy
But I could see, it's not the same
I'm standing here but you don't see me
I'd give it all for that to change
And I don't want to lose her
Don't wanna let her go
Standin' out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
'Cause I will leave you alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm
Yeah, before the storm
With every strike of lightning
Comes a memory that lasts
And not a word is left unspoken
As the thunder starts to crash
Maybe I should give up
Standin' out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
'Cause I will leave you alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm
Trying to keep the lights from going out
And the clouds are ripping out my broken heart
They always say that a heart is not a home
Without the one who gets you through the storm
Standin' out in the rain
Knowing now it's really over
Please don't leave you alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing I'll never hold ya
Like I did before the storm, the storm
Like I did before the storm
