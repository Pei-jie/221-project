Something just isn't right I can feel it inside
The truth isn't far behind me, you can't deny
When I turn the lights out, when I close my eyes
Reality overcomes me, I'm living a lie
When I'm alone, I feel so much better
And when I'm around you, I don't feel
Together, it doesn't feel right at all
Together, together we've built a wall
Together, holding hands we'll fall
Hands we'll fall
This has gone on so long
I realize that I need
Something good to rely on
Something for me
When I'm alone, I feel so much better
And when I'm around you, I don't feel
Together, it doesn't feel right at all
Together, together we've built a wall
Together, holding hands we'll fall
Hands we'll fall
My heart is broken, I'm lying here
My thoughts are choking on you my dear
On you my dear, on you my dear
When I'm alone, I feel so much better
And when I'm around you, I don't feel
Together, it doesn't feel right at all
Together, together we've built a wall
Together, holding hands we'll fall
Hands we'll fall
Together, it doesn't feel right at all
Together, together we've built a wall
Together, holding hands we'll fall
Hands we'll fall
When I'm around you and when I'm around you
I don't feel together, I don't feel together
And when I'm around you, when I'm around you
I don't feel together, no, I don't feel together
