Wow, there is something going down
Like the storm in the sky, ooh
I ain't gonna be played by your behavior
How can I trust someone who's lying to me?
So bow out, go
Now I said bow out and leave
I said take your stuff and go
'Cause you're not for me, no
Mamma knows best when times get hard
And papa always has a joke to make me laugh
See, mamma knows best when I feel down
To bring me up and always keep my feet on solid ground, yeah
See I ain't no old rag doll
That you can pick up and drop
And all of this inconsistent love, yeah
I think it's about time that it S-T-O stops
So bow out, go
Now I said bow out and leave
I said take your stuff and go
'Cause you're not for me, no
Mamma knows best when times get hard
And papa always has a joke to make me laugh
See, mamma knows best when I feel down
To bring me up and always keep my feet on solid ground, yeah
"Just keep the best of my", daddy said to me
Always use humor as your therapy, yeah
Don't ever take life too seriously
Just do you 'cause you do you so perfectly
See, mamma, mamma knows best
See, daddy, daddy knows best
See, mamma, mamma knows
She knows, she knows, she knows
See, mamma knows best when times get hard
And papa always has a joke to make me laugh
See, mamma knows best when I feel down
To bring me up and always keep my feet on the ground
See, mamma, mamma knows best
See, daddy, daddy knows best
See, mamma, mamma knows
See, mamma, mamma knows best
See, daddy, daddy knows best
See, mamma, mamma knows best, yeah, yeah, yeah
