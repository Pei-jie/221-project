Don't walk away
Like you always do
This time
Baby you're the only thing
That's been
On my mind
Ever since you've left
I've been a mess
(You won't answer)
(Your phone)
I'll say it once
And I'll leave you alone
But I gotta let you know
I wanna get back
To the old days
When the phone
Would ring
And I knew it
Was you
I wanna talk back
And get yelled at
Fight for nothing
Like we used to
Oh, kiss me
Like you mean it
Like you miss me
Cause I know that you do
I wanna get back
Get back
With you
Don't look at me that way
I see it in your
Eyes
Don't worry about me
I've been
Fine
I'm not gonna lie
I've been a mess
Since you've left
And every time I see you
It gets more and more
Intense
I wanna get back
To the old days
When the phone
Would ring
And I knew it
Was you
I wanna talk back
And get yelled at
Fight for nothing
Like we used to
Oh, kiss me
Like you mean it
Like you miss me
Cause I know that you do
I wanna get back
Get back
With you
You were the only one
I wanted
And you were the first one
I fell for
You're the only one
That I've been needing
And I don't want to be
Lonely anymore
I wanna get back
To the old days
When the phone
Would ring
And I knew it
Was you
I wanna talk back
And get yelled at
Fight for nothing
Like we used to!
Oh, kiss me
Like you mean it
Like you miss me
Cause I know
That you do
I wanna get back
Get back
With you
(Get back)
Get back
(Get back)
Get back
(Get back)
Get back
(Get back)
Get back
Oh, kiss me
Like you mean it
Like you miss me
Cause I know
That you do
I wanna get back
Get back
I wanna get back
Get back
I wanna get back
Get back
Get back
Yeah, yeah, yeah
