I cant understand how
When the edges are rough and
They cut you like the tiny slivers of glass.
And you feel too much, and you dont know
How long youre going to last.
Everyone you know is trying to smooth it over.
Find a way to make the hurt go away.
Everyone you know is trying to smooth it over.
Like youre trying to scream underwater.
But I wont let you make the great escape
Im never going to watch you checkin out of this place
Im not going to lose you, cause the passion and pain
Are going to keep you alive someday
Gonna keep you alive someday.
I feel like I could wave my fist in front of your face.
And you wouldnt flinch or even feel a thing.
You retreated to your silent corner
Like you decided the fight was over for ya
Everyone you know is trying to smooth it over.
Find a way to make the hurt go away.
Everyone you know is trying to smooth it over.
Everyone needs a floor they could fall through.
I wont let you make the great escape
Im never going to watch you checkin out of this place
Im not going to lose you, cause the passion and pain
Are going to keep you alive someday
Gonna keep you alive someday.
Terrified of the dark, but not if you go with me
And I dont need a pill to make me numb
And I wrote the book on running,
But that chapter of my life would soon be done
Im the king of the great escape
Youre not going to watch me checkin out of this place
Youre not going to lose me, cause the passion and pain
Are going to keep us alive someday
Yeah the passion and the pain
Are going to keep us alive, someday (Someday)
