This ain't about Kings or Queens,
Ain't about to You and Me.
Do you leave? Those are true,
What am I supposed to do?
How can you leave a tea?
Can you test someone to give?
Something for god I know,
You can do with me,
Shut your mouth, sip that TEA!
It's been so long
Since I've had a sip and I get this feeling
I need a green detox
The truth will be the winner tonight
