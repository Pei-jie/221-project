Believe me, Natalie, listen, Natalie
This is your last chance to find
A go go dance to disco now
Please believe me, Natalie, listen, Natalie
This is your last chance to find
A go go dance to disco now
Forget what they said in Soho
Leave the 'Oh no's' out
And believe me, Natalie, listen Natalie
This is your last chance
There is an old cliche
Under your Monet, baby
Remember the arch of roses
Right above your couch
Forget what they said in Soho
Leave the 'Oh no's' out
Yes, there is an old cliche
Under your Monet, baby
You left the station now to the floor
With speculation, what was it for?
In that old hallway, Moses, why don't you say?
You've been away for a long time
Believe me, Natalie
This is your last chance to find a go go
Forget what they said in Soho and walk away
In my dreams, for us, can't get you through
Just one more day, it's alright by me
God, help me somehow
There's no time for survival left
The time is now
'Cause this might be your last chance to disco
