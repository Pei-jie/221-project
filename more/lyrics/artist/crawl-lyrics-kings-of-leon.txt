rock
You fall, my pride
Don't ever need to apologize
As your lips unfold
Shakin' purple from the cold
You better learn to crawl
You better learn to crawl
Before I walk away
Before I walk away
You broke my mouth
The bloody bits are spittin' out
Is your grave unscathed?
The worm is countin' down the day
He wants to see you crawl
He wants to see you crawl
Before I walk away
Before I walk away
The reds and the whites and abused
The crucified USA
As every prophecy unfolds
Oh, hell is surely on its way
The rat and the fly
They're searchin' for an alibi
As we wait the wrath
They never went to Sunday mass
They want to see us crawl
They want to see us crawl
Before they walk away
Before they walk away
The reds and the whites and abused
The crucified USA
As every prophecy unfolds
Oh, hell is surely on its way
