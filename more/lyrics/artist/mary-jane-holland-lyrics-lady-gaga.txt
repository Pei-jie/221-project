Lady of the 'Dam
Won't be a Slave to the Blonde
Or the Culture of the Popular
She won't, She won't!
Sing at you I'll
Fly under Radar tonight
Make deals with every Devil in Sight
I will, I will!
'Cuz I love love, Cuz I love love
You better than, You better than
My Darkest Sin
Russian hookers
And Cheap gin
I Think that I Could be Fine
If I Could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I Think we'd have a Good time
If you'd Meet me Mary Jane in Holland tonight
Mary Jane Holland, whoo-hoo
Mary Jane Holland, (puff in, puff out!)
I Don't like to Boast
But our Truffles are the Most
Mad-magical in Amsterdam
She won't, She won't
So if you have Fear!
Apollo, sit on my lyre and
Play him like a Piano man
I will, I will!
'Cuz I love love, Cuz I love love
You better than, You better than
My Darkest Sin
Russian hookers
And Cheap gin
I Think that I Could be Fine
If I Could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I Think we'd have a Good time
If you'd Meet me Mary Jane in Holland tonight
Mary Jane Holland, whoo-hoo
Mary Jane Holland, (puff in, puff out!)
I know that Mom and Dad think I'm a Mess
But it's Alright because
I am Rich as Piss
When I ignite the flame and Put you in my Mouth
The Grass eats up my Insides and
My Brunette starts to Sprout
Introducing, Ladies and Gentleman
Mary Jane Holland!
I Think that I Could be Fine
If I Could be Mary Jane Holland tonight
I Think we'd have a Good time
If you'd Meet me Mary Jane in Holland tonight
Mary Jane Holland, whoo-hoo
Mary Jane Holland, (puff in, puff out!)
Mary Jane Holland, whoo-hoo
Mary Jane Holland, whoo-hoo
