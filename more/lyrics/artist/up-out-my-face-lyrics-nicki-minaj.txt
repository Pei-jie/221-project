pop
It's not chipped, we're not cracked
Oh, we're shattered
Mariah, Young Money
Nicki Minaj, you're such a Barbie
Yo, Mariah, I was in a million dollar meetin' he was cheatin'
All up in the church he was sneakin' with the deacon
Cat's away while the mice will play
L-O-L, smiley face, have a nice day
'Cause pop, pop, pop, there goes my rubber band
So stop, stop, stop censoring that contraband
'Cause you was penny pinchin', my account's laced
Attention, about face
I thought we had something special and we had something good
But I should have had another mechanic under my hood
If you see me walkin' by you, boy, don't you even speak
Pretend you're on a sofa and I'm on the TV
Might see me on a poster, see me at a show
But you won't see me for free, boy, this ain't no promo
Actin' all shamed now
Wherever you been layin' you can stay now
Gotta board the BBG and pull the shades down, I'm on the plane now
And don't keep callin' from your momma house
When I break, I break, boy
Up out my face, boy, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break
Up out my face, boy, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break
You ain't ever gonna feel this thing again
You gon' get a lot of calls 'cause I cc'd all your friends
I ain't walkin' around all mopey and sad
That ain't even my bag, baby, I break
So look who's cryin' now, boo hoo hoo
Talkin' about you're missin' your boo, hoo hoo
I know you ain't getting it, I know you ain't hittin' it
No, you ain't a rapper so you need to stop spittin' it
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, you'll wonder who I'm messin' with
While you ain't next to me
I'm going bye, so pay the consequences
'Cause you acting all ignorant
So you ashamed now
Wherever you been layin' you can stay now
Gotta board the BBG and pull the shades down, I'm on the plane now
And don't keep callin' from your momma house
When I break, I break
Stylin' on them big B's with the Benz out
Elevator, press P for the penthouse
Top dogs, yeah, we break like tacos
Roscoe's on his knees with a snot nose
They be like, "She next", Kawasaki, T-Rex
Give him some Kleenex, match his little V-necks
Oh, that's what he left? Let his momma pick it up
Might back up on it, vroom-vroom, with a pick-up truck
That blue and yellow, yeah, that's the Carmello Jag
I bob and weave and hit them with the Mayweather jab
I get the thumbs up like I'm hailin' a yellow cab
My flow nuts like I'm hotter than a yellow tag
'Cause when I break, I break, I break
And no super glue can fix this s***
When I break, I break, I break
Not even a welder and a builder can rebuild this s***
When I break, I break, I break
Not even a nail technician with a whole lot of gel and acrylic can fix this
When I break, I break
If we were two Lego blocks even the Harvard University
Graduating class of 2010 couldn't put us back together again
When I break, boy
Up out my face, boy, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break
Up out my face, boy, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break
You ain't ever gonna feel this thing again
(I told you, I put, I put your stuff on the sidewalk)
You gonna get a lot of calls 'cause I cc'd all your friends
(I will go over every nook and cranny with a pick-up truck)
I ain't walkin' around all mopey and sad
(Like straight up and down, this is Nicki Minaj, if they ask about me)
They're collecting my bags, baby, I break boy
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break
