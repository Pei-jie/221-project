rock
I got a friend
Shows me all the good times
Tells me I look better
Chews me up and spits me out
And then wants my eyes home
And sings a song
When I'm gone, gone, gone
I got a friend
Shoots me up and downtown
When I can't get me drunk enough
She takes me out the pieces
Of a place I call home
To sing a song
Till I'm gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
I've got a friend
Who helps me to get up again
Showers me in bruises
Tells me I've got a big old [unverified]
And she wants my eyes home
To sing a song
Till I'm gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
