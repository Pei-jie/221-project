Jade
She lives in the shadow of a lonely girl
Voice so quiet you don't hear a word
Always talking but she can't be heard
Leigh-Anne
You can see it there if you catch her eye
I know she's brave but its trapped inside
Scared to talk but she don't know why
All
Wish I knew back then what I know now
Wish I could somehow
Go back in time and maybe listen to my own advice
I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out
Talk a bit louder be a bit prouder
tell her she's beautiful, wonderful,
everything she doesn't see
You gotta speak up , you gotta shout out
And know that right here right now
You could be beautiful, wonderful,
anything you want to be
Jesy
Little Me
Yeah you got a lot of time to act your age
Can't write a book from a single page
Hands on the clock only turn one way
Perrie
Run too fast and you'll risk it all
Cant be afraid to take a fall
Felt so big but she looked so small
All
Wish I knew back then what I know now
Wish I could somehow
Go back in time and maybe listen to my own advice
I'd tell her to speak up tell her to shout out
Talk a bit louder be a bit prouder
tell her she's beautiful, wonderful,
everything she doesn't see
(and know that i'm right here right now)
You gotta speak up, (speak up)
you gotta shout out (shout out)
And know that right here right now
You could be beautiful, wonderful,
anything you want to be
Oh Little Me
Little Me Yeah
Leigh-Anne
Tell you one thing i would say yeah
All
I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out
Talk a bit louder be a bit prouder
tell her she's beautiful, wonderful,
everything she doesn't see
You gotta speak up , you gotta shout out
And know that right here right now
You could be beautiful, wonderful,
anything you want to be
I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out
Talk a bit louder be a bit prouder
tell her she's beautiful, wonderful,
everything she doesn't see
You gotta speak up , you gotta shout out
And know that right here right now
You could be beautiful, wonderful,
anything you want to be
I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out
Talk a bit louder be a bit prouder
tell her she's beautiful, wonderful,
everything she doesn't see
You gotta speak up , you gotta shout out
And know that right here right now
You could be beautiful, wonderful,
anything you want to be
