You're stuck in the playground and I'm a grown woman now
Considering you hate me, You're stalking like you made me
So why you acting like you tough
But now I thought you, had enough
Don't you get tired of being rude
Come and give me a hug dude
Let's go
It's my party, I do do what I want (do do what I want)
So while you sit and watch me
I keep dancing alone, da-dancing alone
So put this record on and keep it going, till I say stop
If you were wondering if I give a damn, well I do not
It's my party, I do do what I want (do do what I want)
I think it's time you realize
You're only wasting your time
Addicted to attention, you need an intervention
So while you acting like you're sick
Sitting around and talking shit
Dont you get tired of being alone
Aww, your only friend is your phone
It's my party, I do do what I want (do do what I want)
So while you sit and watch me
I keep dancing alone, da-dancing alone
So put this record on and keep it going, till I say stop
If you were wondering if I give a damn, well I do not
It's my party, I do do what I want (do do what I want
You think I speak too much, I dont care, dont care
You think I tweet too much, I dont care, dont care
You think my clothes are crazy, I dont care, dont care
Well maybe im crazy, cray cray cray go!
It's my party, I do do what I want (do do what I want)
So while you sit and watch me
I keep dancing alone, da-dancing alone
So put this record on and keep it going, till I say stop
If you were wondering if I give a damn, well I do not
It's my party, I do do what I want (do do what I want)
