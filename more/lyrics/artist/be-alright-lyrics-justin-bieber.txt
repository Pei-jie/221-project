Ooh, Ooh..
Across the ocean, across the sea
Startin' to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face and need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and, through the clouds
Bumps on the road and upside down now
I know it's hard baby, to sleep at night
Don't you worry
Cause Everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Through the sorrow,
And the fights
Don't you worry,
Cause everything's gonna Be Alright,ai-ai-ai-aight
Be Alright,ai-ai-ai-aight..
All alone, in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms
Holding my heart
Oh I, Oh I...
I Love You
And Everything's gonna Be Alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be Alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Through the long nights
And the bright lights
Dont you worry
Cause Everything's gonna Be Alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be Alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
You know that I care for you
I'll always be there for you
Promise I will stay right here, yeah
I know that you want me too
Baby we can make it through, anything
Cause everything's gonna Be Alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be Alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Through the sorrow, and the fights
Dont you worry
Everything's gonna Be Alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be Alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Through the sorrow, and the fights
Don't you worry
Everything's gonna Be Alright..
