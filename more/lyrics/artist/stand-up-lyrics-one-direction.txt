[Verse 1:]
From the moment I met you, everything changed
I knew I had to get you, whatever the pain
[Harry]
I had to take you and make you mine
[Niall]
(take you and make you mine)
[Liam]
I would walk through the desert
I would walk down the aisle
I would swim all the oceans just to see you smile
[Harry]
Whatever it takes is fine
[Niall]
Whatever it takes is fine
[All]
Oh oh ohh oh
[Harry]
So put your hands up
Oh oh ohh oh
[Harry]
'Cause its a stand up
I wont be leaving til I finish stealing every piece of your heart
Every piece of your heart
[Louis]
I know your heart's been broken
But dont you give up
Ill be there, yeah I know it
To fix you with love
[Niall]
It hurts me to think that youve ever cried
[All]

So put your hands up
Oh oh ohh oh

'Cause its a stand up
I wont be leaving til I finish stealing every piece of your heart
Every piece of your heart

So put your hands up
[All]
Oh oh ohh oh
[Harry]
'Cause its a stand up
I wont be leaving til I finish stealing every piece of your heart
[Zayn]
And I will steal us a car
And we will drive to the stars
I will give you the moon
Its the least I can do if you give me the chance
[All]
