For the world
Make it real, baby
Uh, Desert Storm, baby
Uh, check it
This for you
Thank God I found you
Let's show the world you're my golden girl, when we shoppin'
They see us on the streets, they say, "Son, scooped a hot one"
You taste like banana cake, you shaped like the number eight
And you my number one candidate
I can't lose you, it's like I'm bettin' in Vegas, crucial
Sweatin' knowin' these players is wantin' you, Boo
I get the chills when you in my sight
Feels like it's meant to be right
I feel a rush when I kiss you at night, uh
Shorty knows she my baby girl and
Players haters try hard to get her
But she'll be lounging in my cradle tonight
Typically I wouldn't say this
But you see your love has got me faded
No girl ever made me feel like you do
Oh I'm ma be here night after night to
Feel your lovin' arms around me
Baby baby, baby, baby, you make it all right
No one but you, baby, baby can make me feel
The way you make me, make me, make me feel
We make it last, make it last
We make it last, make it last
Make it last
We make it last, make it last
We make it last, make it last
Don't let our let our love end
Oh don't you let it end
Make it last forever and ever
Thank God I found you
Your touch is wonderful
Your love is so marvelous
Joy, that's what I feel
When I'm with you, yeah
Nothing, no one, no one, boy
Could compare to what we have
Oh, no, baby
Love, it feels so good
I'm so glad you're mine
We make it last, make it last
We make it last, make it last
Make it last forever
We make it last, make it last
We make it last, make it last
Don't let our love end
No, no
Make it last forever and ever
Thank God I found you
What, a thug's dream wife, jeans tight, beautiful skin
Matchin' brown Timbs, hot as jalapenos
She knows how to hide the ninos
The rap root of Valentino
And B5 become the black Al Pacino
Relax, sweetie, in Benz you could watch the TV
Or lay back and pump Mariah's hot CD
And I'm ma touch you in the wrong places
Or we could walk through the park
Above in all faces, I'm lost in your love
Thank God I found you, you my crown jewel
I'm sayin', Boo, the type I'd give my last name to
At Lovers Lane put the top up
When it start to rain in the parkin' lot
Then we finish doin' our thing
Fog the windows gettin' very sentimental
Sippin' Cosmos with the cherry in the middle
I keep it honest, word to real, that's my promise
Signin' off, truly yours, Nastradamus
Thank God I found you
Thank God I found you
I was so lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
But sometimes I can't blame my whole life
