[Intro:]
Owww
Ho
Owww
[Verse 1:]
Baby, does he do it for ya?
When hes finished does he step back and adore ya?
I just gotta know
Cause ya time is money and I wont let him waste it
Oh no noooo
Baby just go with it
Cause when your with me I cant explain it
Its just different
We can take it slow
Or act like your my girl
Lets skip the basics, whoa
[Chorus:]
Hes so replaceable
You're worth the chase, you're putting on
Its alright, I'm not dangerous
When you're mine I'll be generous
You're irreplaceable
A collectible
Just like fine china
[Verse 2:]
Baby, you're my favorite
Its like all the girls around me, dont have faces
And the saying goes,
Life if just a game but I'm not playin'
[Chorus:]
Hes so replaceable
You're worth the chase, you're good enough
Its alright, I'm not dangerous
When you're mine I'll be generous
You're irreplaceable
A collectible
Just like fine china
Its alright, I'm not dangerous
When you're mine I'll be generous
You're irreplaceable
A collectible
Just like fine china
[Verse 3:]
Took me awhile to find your love
Ain't no amount of time in this world
Save me a lot of time and just love me
Feel it, baby, feel it in your soul
Are you ready?
I know your heart been telling you, you belong to me
I kno kno know
[Chorus:]
Its alright, I'm not dangerous
When you're mine, I'll be generous
You're irreplaceable
Uncollectible
Just like fine china
