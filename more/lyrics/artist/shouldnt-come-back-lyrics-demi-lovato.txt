See you calling again; I don't wanna pick up, no
I've been laying in bed, probably thinking too much, oh oh
Sorry I'm not sorry for the times, I dont reply
You know the reason why
Maybe you shouldn't come back
Maybe you shouldn't come back to me
Tired of being so sad, tired of getting so mad, baby
Stop right now, you'll only let me down, oh oh
Maybe you shouldn't come back
Maybe you shouldn't come back to me
Trying not to forget, should be easier than this, oh oh
All the birthdays you've missed
I was only a kid, oh oh
Sorry I'm not sorry for the times I don't reply
You know the reason why
Maybe you shouldn't come back
Maybe you shouldn't come back to me
Tired of being so sad, tired of getting so mad, baby
Stop right now, you only let me down, oh oh
Maybe you shouldn't come back
Maybe you shouldn't come back to me
To me
Sorry, I'm not sorry for the times
Maybe you shouldn't come back
Maybe you shouldn't come back, to me
Tired of being so sad, tired of getting so mad, baby
Stop right now, you'll only let me down, oh oh
Maybe you shouldn't come back
Maybe you shouldn't come back to me
Maybe you shouldn't come back to me
