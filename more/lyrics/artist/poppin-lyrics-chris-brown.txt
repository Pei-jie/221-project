You got that look in yo' eyes
That look, like you give yo' boy here a good ol' time

See this is the first time I had a girl
Who looks set me on fire
I'm really tryna get to know you better, girl
You ain't gotta act like you shy
'Cause we gon' do something
Something is gon' get done
And we gon' get crunk
And have a lot of fun

Jump through about four or five hoops of ooh baby

Oh yes, you're mean and vicious, the way you switchin'
Now I say this is the first time I had a girl
Who looks at me on fire
