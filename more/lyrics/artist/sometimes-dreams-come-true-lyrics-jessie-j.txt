When I was little, I sing in my hairbrush all day long
Dressed up with lipstick, I'd mime and dance to a Whitney-song, yeah
I watched the Grammy's
Imagine them calling out my name
Dreaming I was famous,
Like me and Prince on Purple Rain
Wanted to be the "it" girl
On the cover of the Rolling Stones
Flying all around the world
Hear my s-songs on the r-r-radio
Hittin' double Platinum, selling out shows everywhere I go
My face on a thousand Billboards, Trafalgar Square to Tokyo
Yeah, yeah, wrote it in a misspelled tattoo
Yeah, yeah, I cut my hair and I dyed it blue
Yeah, yeah, sang a thousands "I Love You's"
Did what I had to do, somehow I knew
If you believe in you
Sometimes dreams come true, yeah yeah
Sometimes dreams come true, yeah yeah
Sshh..
I found YouTube, and YouTube found me, yeah
I made fans from London, all the way to Tenessee
Looks like i started a p-p-p-party in the USA
Just a little girl with big dreams
She's still reppin' for the UK
Things are changing
Some people even wanna have a picture with me
Aww man that's crazy
Cause I'm just an average girl with OCD
Yeah, yeah, wrote it in a misspelled tattoo
Yeah, yeah, I cut my hair and I dyed it blue
Yeah, yeah, sang a thousands "I Love You's"
Did what I had to do, somehow I knew
If you believe in you
Sometimes dreams come true, yeah yeah
Sometimes dreams come true, yeah yeah

I wanna meet Paris
Italy, Germany, Sweden and Rome
Bejing and Hong Kong
I wanna go party all around the globe
Design my theme park
And star in my own Broadway-show
Maybe just one day (maybe just one day)
Yeah, yeah, wrote it in a misspelled tattoo
Yeah, yeah, I cut my hair and I dyed it blue
Yeah, yeah, sang a thousands "I Love You's"
Did what I had to do, somehow I knew
If you believe in you
Sometimes dreams come true, yeah yeah
Sometimes dreams come true, yeah yeah

Yeah, yeah, sang a thousands "I Love You's"
Did what I had to do, somehow I knew
If you believe in you
