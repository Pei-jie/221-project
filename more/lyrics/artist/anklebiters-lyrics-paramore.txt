Paramore
rock
Why do you care what people think
Are you hooked up to their leash
You know, anklebiters
Ate up your personality
Try to remember how it felt
To just make up your own steps
And let anklebiters
Chew up and spit out someone else
Fall in love with yourself
Because
Someday youre gonna be the only one youve got
Someday youre gonna be the only one youve got
Why do you want to please the world
and leave yourself to drop dead?
Someday youre gonna be the only one youve got
What do you actually expect?
A broken mirror to reflect
You know, anklebiters
Gave you a false perception
And why do I defend your ignorance
And why do I defend the state you're in when you should
Fall in love with yourself
Oh, again
Fall in love with yourself
Because
Someday youre gonna be the only one youve got
Someday youre gonna be the only one youve got
Why do you want to please the world
and leave yourself to drop dead?
Someday youre gonna be the only one youve got
Anklebiters!
Anklebiters!
Someday you're gonna be alone
Anklebiters!
Anklebiters!
