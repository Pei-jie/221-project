Many nights we've prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
And our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know theres much to fear
We were moving mountains long
Before we know we could
Oh yes, there can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill
Who knows what miracle
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe
In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away
And now I am standing here
My hearts so full, I cant explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought Id say
There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe
They dont always happen when you ask
And its easy to give in to your fear, ohh
But when youre blinded by your pain
Cant see your way safe through the rain
Thought of a still resilient voice
Says love is very near
There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will, how you will
You will when you believe
You will when you believe
Just believe
You will when you believe
Just believe
You will when you believe
