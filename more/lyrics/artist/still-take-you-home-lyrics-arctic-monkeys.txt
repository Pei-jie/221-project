Oh it's ever so funny
Cause I dont think youre special
I dont think youre cool
Youre just probably alright
But under these lights you look beautiful
And Im strugglin
I cant see through your fake tan
Yeah, you know it for a fact
That everybodys eatin out of your hands
But what do you know?
Oh you know nothing!
Yeah, but I'll still take you home
Yeah, I'll still take you home
So what do you know?
Said you dont know nothing!
Well fancy seein you in here
You're all tarted up and you don't look the same
Well I haven't seen ya since last year
Yeah surprisingly you have forgotten my name
But you know it, yeah you knew it all along
Oh an you say you have forgotten
But you're fibbing, go on tell me I'm wrong
So what do you know?

You're a Topshop princess, a rock star too
But youre a fad, youre a fashion
And Im having a job trying to talk to you

Youve got control of everyone's eyes
Including mine
