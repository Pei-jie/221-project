You dont have to look like a movie star
Ooh I think you're good just the way you are
Tell me if you could would you up and run away with me?
You dont have to roll like a millionaire
Baby I would go with you anywhere
We don't need no gold, we'll be shining anyway, you'll see
You know can nobody get down like us
We dont stop till we get enough
Cmon, turn it up till the speakers pop
Break it down, show me what you've got
Ooh my my baby dont be shy
I see that spark flashing in your eye
My heart beats fast cause I want it all
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la
Take my hand, we can go all night
And spin me round just the way I like
It feels so good, I dont wanna stop
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la
You dont have to wear no designer clothes
Just as long as were dancing on the floor
Fingers in my hair and Im letting go tonight, so free
You know can nobody get down like us
We dont stop till we get enough
Cmon, turn it up till the speakers pop
Break it down, show me what youve got
Ooh my my baby dont be shy
I see that spark flashing in your eye
My heart beats fast cause I want it all
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la
Take my hand, we can go all night
And spin me round just the way I like
It feels so good, I dont wanna stop
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la
Be my ooh la la (x16)
Ooh my my baby dont be shy
I see that spark flashing in your eye
Ooh my my baby dont be shy
I see that spark flashing in your eye
My heart beats fast cause I want it all
So baby come with me and be my ooh la la
Take my hand, we can go all night
And spin me round just the way I like
It feels so good, I dont wanna stop
So baby come with me and be my ooh la
Baby come with me and be my ooh la la
Baby come with me and be my ooh la la
