The%20Killers
rock
Time it tells living in my hometown
Wedding bells they begin easy
Live it down, baby, dont talk that much
Baby knows, but baby, dont tease me
In the park we could go walking
Drown in the dark or we could go sailing on the sea
Always here, always on time
Close call, was it love or was it just easy?
Money talks when people need shoes and socks
Steady boys, I'm thinking she needs me
I was just sipping on something sweet
I dont need political process
I got this feeling that theyre gonna break down the door
I got this feeling that theyre gonna come back for more
See I was thinking that I lost my mind
But its been getting to me all this time
And it dont stop dragging me down
Silently reflection turns my world to stone
Patiently correction leaves us all alone
And sometimes Im a travel man
But tonight this engine's failing
I still hear the children playing
Kick the can, kick the can, skip and blackjack
Steal a car and ring a round-rosey
Rock and roll, candy land, bogeyman
Run away and give me your sneakers
Acid rain, when Abel looked up at Cain
We began the weeping and wailing
A hurried high from pestilence, pills and pride
Its a shame, we could have gone sailing
But heaven knows, heaven knows everything, tranquilize
I got this feeling that theyre gonna break down the door
I got this feeling that theyre gonna come back for more
See I was thinking that I lost my mind
But its been getting to me all this time
And it dont stop dragging me down
Silently reflection turns my world to stone
Patiently correction leaves us all alone
And sometimes Im a travel man
But tonight this engine's failing
I still hear the children playing
Dead beat dancers come to us and stay
'Cause I dont care where you've been
And I dont care what you've seen
Were the ones who still believe
And were looking for a page
In that lifeless book of hope
Where a dream might help you cope
With the Bushes and the bombs are tranquilized
