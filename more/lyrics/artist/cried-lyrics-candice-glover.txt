There's nothing left
'Cause you took it all
I hope to fly
But you make me fall
And I'm tired, oh I
I kept a smile for all those years
But I'm so sick of finding my tears
I'm so tired, oh I
And I'm, am I waiting?
No more holding it in
So I cried, and I cried
And I cried, and I cried
So I cried, for all of the pain that you brought
And I cried, for all of the heart ache you caused
I tried to be the girl that never complains
But holding it in is driving me insane
So I cried, oh I cried
I'm on a limb
And I'm 'bout to jump
I gave it all
But you gave me none
And I'm tired, oh I
Down inside, feel it coming now
I wanna but I kissed, I'm now
And I'm tired, oh I
And I'm, am I waiting?
No more holding it in
So I cried, and I cried
And I cried, and I cried
This is for every time I let it go
All of the nights I spent alone
It's been too hard to hold back the pain
So like the cloud let it fall like the rain
Yes I'm gon' make a sound
'Cause I'm crying out loud
So I cried, for all of the pain that you brought
And I cried, for all of the heart ache you caused (caused)
I tried to be the girl that never complains
But holding it in is driving me insane
So I cried, and I cried
And I cried, and I cried
I Cried, and I cried
And I cried, and I cried
I Cried, and I cried
And I cried, and I cried
