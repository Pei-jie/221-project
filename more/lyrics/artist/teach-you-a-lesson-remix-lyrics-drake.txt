Man, you so crucial baby and that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you aint used to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
My raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy,
thats a metaphor did I lose you baby?
When you are wet
And covered in sweat
I wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
I love all my feed back
Tell me to give it to you if you need that
Touch right there whatever the speeds at
If its over fast then I promise you a relapse
Forget what you guessin Im on
And who was in yo past
Im a freshly grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you the lettuce girl Ima bring the dressing along
You hear that professional tone?
Half of thats ice and the rest petrone
Show up on time for the class Im teachin
Cuz guaranteed Ima bring a lesson along
An you just gotta bring yo breastes along
Instead of holdin out wonderin what it couldve been
I confess this address to you and
Im the postman lookin for a slot I can put it in
With no NY number
Moms still upstairs Im two floors under
but my rooms soundproof
You so tempted
to satisfy ya urge so that you dont wonder (yeah)
I know I told ya before
Ill grab that fo ya like holdin tha door
Cause mines is Polo and yours is Vicky
and they just spread all over the floor, like
