doomed from the start
we met with a goodbye kiss, i broke my wrist
it all kicked off, i had no choice
you said that you didnt mind cause loves hard to find
maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
open your eyes and what do you see?
no more laughs, no more photographs
turning slowly, looking back, see
no words, can save this, youre broken and im pissed
run along like im supposed to, be the man i ought to
rock and roll, sent us insane, i hope someday that we will meet again
running wild
giving it everyone, now thats all done
cause we burnt out, thats what you do
when you have everything, it cant be true
maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
open youre eyes and what do you see?
the last stand, let go of my hand
turning slowly, looking back, see
no words, can save this, youre broken and im pissed
run along like im supposed to, be the man i ought to
rock and roll, sent us insane, i hope someday that we will meet again
you go your way and ill go my way
no words can save us, this lifestyle made us
run along like im supposed to, be the man i ought to
rock and roll, sent us insane, i hope someday that we will meet again
