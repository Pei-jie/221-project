Where do we go, who knows?
But each day gets better, I just cant let her go
Oh no, each kiss gets sweeter
I just cant leave her, no
Ill write a song
I've thought about it for far too long
But Ive never had someone to sing about
Until I met her, now each day gets better
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody else understands me like she
Now that I know what true love means
I just hope she stays with me
Where do we go, who knows?
But each day gets better, I just cant let her go
Oh no, each kiss gets sweeter
I just cant leave her, no
She wants to breathe
She wants to be where the grass is green
She wants to know how loves supposed to be
She wants it better, I want to let her know
She belongs right here with me
Shes heard it all but Ill make her see
Ill make her fall, make her believe
Ill promise her that Ill never leave
Where do we go, who knows?
But each day gets better, I just cant let her go
Oh no, each kiss gets sweeter
I just cant leave her, no
Oh no, each kiss gets sweeter
I just cant leave her, no
I just had to write a song about her
Tell her I dont want to live without her
Tell her I would build my world around her
Deeper and deeper, sweeter and sweeter
Ill never leave her alone
Where do we go, who knows?
But each day gets better, I just cant let her go
Oh no, each kiss gets sweeter
I just cant leave her, no
Each day gets better, I just cant let her go
Each kiss gets sweeter
