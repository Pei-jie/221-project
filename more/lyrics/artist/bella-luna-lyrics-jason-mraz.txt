rock
Mystery the moon, a hole in the sky
A supernatural night light, so full but often right
A pair of eyes, a closing one, a chosen child in golden sun
A marble dog that chases cars to farthest reaches of the beach
And far beyond into the swimming sea of stars
The cosmic fish they love to kiss
They're giving birth to constellations
No riffs and, oh, no reservation
If they should fall you'd get a wish or dedication
May I suggest you get the best
For nothing less than you and I
Let's take a chance as this romance
Is rising over before we lose the lighting
Oh, Bella Bella please
Bella, you beautiful Luna
Oh Bella, do what you do
You are an illuminating anchor
Of leagues to infinite number
Of crashing waves and breaking thunder
Tiding the ebb an' flows of hunger
You're dancing naked there for me
You expose all memory
You make the most of boundary
You're the ghost of royalty imposing love
You are the queen and king combining everything
Intertwining like a ring around the finger of a girl
I'm just a singer, you're the world
All I can bring you is the language of a lover
Bella Luna, my beautiful beautiful moon
How you swoon me like no other, oh
May I suggest you get the best
Of your wish may I insist
That no contest for little you or smaller I
A larger chance set but all them may lie
On the rise, on the brink of our lives
Bella please
Bella, you beautiful Luna
Oh Bella, do what you do
Bella Luna, my beautiful beautiful moon
How you swoon me like no other, oh
