pop
right now its the ______ spot
with fizzer and dot
we've got a villanous plot
to make billions watch
bringing the hot flows
skippin across
delivering some of the illest bars
killing them off?
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
yeah we're doing the damn thing
man think we need them
but onna dat thing
nah i'm back in this raptures?
double my adlibs
got them all banging the anthems
having a madness
for me the musics
the thorn in my vein
calling my name
yeah we're lord of the raves
i swear down i got them all talking my name
been working all year it's the ultimate gain
uh
look i don't need you
making us angry we were so peaceful
you don't really wanna see us get so lethal
any foe to approach
will be ghosted and don't be fooled
yes people
you need me man i don't need you x8
yeah
yeah i'm messed up everybody's hyped
even a blind man can see the devil in my eyes
many were the times
that he saw me stepping on the mic
setting it alight
come up with the energy and vibe
when i come back from a coma
stronger than ever
songs are forever
so i'm living longer than ever
any genre whatever
i'll be setting off a bomb
coz my longevity's just too long for a measure
well i'm setting off better
i'm taking over faster
showering down
you better put your umbrella on
yeah i'm stepping up a level
got my foot on the pedal
i'm coming to be the better vision than ____ when i'm spitting
they had to resist
because they need a stage to perform
case and a cord
you won't see me pace through the door
thinking i'm gonna be rich so i'm chasing the thought
spreading like a plague the songs when i soar
____
you need me man i don't need you x8
you need me man i don't need you x8
living out our days in _____
if i went crazy in a whip crashing the ride
double p when we enter that's passion and pride
they aint gotta life coz they let that battery die
i'm a shooting star that aint catching your eye
an assasin with lines and immaculate rhymes
they all say that they're the truth but it's actually lies
so we hit them with a punch like a Cassidy line
yeah i tried to relax but you can feel the anger inside
raging like i stand on the right
yeah my stamina is high
yeah i'm living like i stand with the Mayans
so think twice coz our plans are defiant/devine/defined
it's blatent you need me
who's this face on the TV
come on we're taking it easy
got kids in the school exchanging the CD
love hearing the bars impatient to chear me
you need me man i don't need you x8
you need me man i don't need you x8
