Yo, brotha A to Z
Yo, wussup B
Yo, what time is it?
It's Laundry Day
Do do do
Do do do
Do do do
Well, let the geek in the pink take a stab at it
If you like the way I'm thinkin', baby, wink at it
I may be skinny at times but I'm fat fulla rhymes
Pass me the mic and I'm a grab at it
Well, isn't it delicious, crazy way that I'm kissin'
This baby listen to this, don't wanna miss it while it's hittin'
Sometimes you gotta fit in to get in
But don't ever quit 'cause soon I'm gonna let you in but see
I don't care what you might think about me
You'll get by without me if you want
Well, I could be the one to take you home
Baby, we could rock the night alone
If we never get down
It wouldn't be a let down
But sugar don't forget
What you already know
That I could be the one to turn you out
We could be the talk across the town
Don't judge it by the color, confuse it for another
You might regret what you let slip away
Like the geek in the pink
Well, like the geek in the pink, yeah
The geek in the pink
Well, my relationship fodder, don't mean to bother nobody
But Cupid's automatic, musta fired multiple shots at her
Because she fall in love too often, that's what the matter
At least I'm talkin' about it, keep my pattern of flattery and
She was starin' through the door frame and
Eyeing me down like already a bad boyfriend
Well, she can get her toys outta the drawer then
'Cause I ain't comin' home, I don't need that attention, see
I don't care what she might think about me
She'll get by without me if she wants
Well, I could be the one to take her home
Baby, we could rock the night alone
If we never get down
It wouldn't be a let down
But sugar don't forget
What you already know
That I could be the one to turn you out
We could be the talk across the town
Don't judge it by the color, confuse it for another
You might regret what you let slip away
Hey, baby, look at me, go from zero to hero
You better take it from a geek like me
Well, I can save you from unoriginal dum-dums
Who wouldn't care if you complete him or not
So what I've got, a short attention span, a coke in my hand
Because I'd rather have the afternoon, relaxin' understand
My hip hop and flip-flops, well, it don't stop with the light rock
My shot to mock, you kinda puts me in the tight spot
The hype is nothing more than hoo-ha, so I'm
Developing a language and I'm callin' it my own
So take a peek into the speaker and you'll see what I mean
That on the other side the grass is greener
I don't care what you might think about me
You'll get by without me if you want
I could be the one to take you home
Baby, we could rock the night alone
If we never get down
It wouldn't be a let down
But sugar don't forget
What you already know
I could be the one to turn you out
We could be the talk across the town
Don't judge it by the color, confuse it for another
You might regret what you let slip away
Like the geek in the pink
Well, I'm the geek in the pink ya'll
Geek is the color for power
I'm the geek in the pink
So I'm the geek ya'll, in the pink ya'll
Geek is the color for power
I'm the geek in the pink
