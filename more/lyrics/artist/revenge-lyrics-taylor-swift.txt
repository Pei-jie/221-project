I could've keyed your car
I could've rolled your yard
I know the passwords to your emails
Everything you do
I could've put them to good use
But I'm dressed to kill
And tonight I'm goin out on a date
With your best friend
He always liked me anyway
R-E-V-E-N-G-E
My list of things to do this week
Jealousy, misery
Gon' give you what you gave to me
Make you feel so B-A-D
Break you, make you so-orry
I hope you cry
Im gettin' my
R-E-V-E-N-G-E
So I'm gonna paint the town with him
Replace your memory everywhere we've ever been
I don't hang out at smoky bars
But I know we'll see you there
And I'll make you hear me laughin'
Like I just don't care
I know you hate my friends
So tonight I called them all
And later on you can excpect some
Prank phone calls baby
R-E-V-E-N-G-E
My list of things to do this week
Jealousy, misery
Gon' give you what you gave to me
Make you feel so B-A-D
Break you, make you so-orry
I hope you cry
I'm gettin' my
R-E-V-E-N-G-E
S-A-N-I-T-Y
I hope you lose yours tonight
You've made me crazy too long
And so I'm working on
R-E-V-E-N-G-E
My list of things to do this week
Jealousy, misery
And give you what you gave to me
Make you feel so B-A-D
Break you, make you so-orry
I hope you cry
I'm gettin' my
R-E-V-E-N-G-E
baby

R-E-V-E-N-G-E
oh
And give you what you gave to me
Oh
