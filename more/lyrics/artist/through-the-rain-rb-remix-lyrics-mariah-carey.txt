When you get caught in the rain with nowhere to run
When you are distraught and in pain without anyone
When you keep crying out to be saved
But nobody comes and you feel so far away
That you just can't find your way home
You can get there alone it's okay once you say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong enough to mend
And everytime I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain
And if you keep falling down
Don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound
So keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you'll need to prevail
Once you say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong enough to mend
And everytime I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain
And when the wind blows
And shadows grow close
Don't be afraid, there's nothing you can't face
And should they tell you
You'll never pull through
Don't hesitate, stand tall and say
I, I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong enough to mend
And everytime I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain
I can make it through the rain
And stand up once again
And I'll live one more day
And I, I can make it through the rain
Oh yes you can
You're gonna make it through the rain
