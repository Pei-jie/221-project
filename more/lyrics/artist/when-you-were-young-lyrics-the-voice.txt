You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness,
Watch him now, here he come!
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus but he
Talks like a gentleman like you imagined
When you were young
Can we climb this mountain?
I don't know
Higher now than ever before I
Know we can make it if we take it slow
That's takin easy
easy now watch it go!
We're burning down the highway skyline on the
back of a hurricane that started turnin'
When you were young
When you were young
And sometimes you close your eyes
and see the place where you used to live
When you were young
They say the devil's water it aint so sweet
You don't have to drink right now
but you can dip feet
every once in the little while
Woo!
Save me!
You sit there in your heartache
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness
Watch him now, here he come!
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus but he
Talks like a gentleman like you imagined
When you were young
(Talks like a gentleman like you imagined when)
When you were young
I said he doesn't look a thing like Jesus
He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But more than you'll ever know
