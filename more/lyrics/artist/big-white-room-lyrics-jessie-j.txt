Siting in a big, white room alone
Tilt my head back, feel the tears fall down
Close my eyes to see in the dark
Beyond broken, so, so scared
I don't wanna be here anymore, I wanna be somewhere else
Normal and free like I used to be
But I have to stay in this big, white room
With little old me
I'm going crazy, I'm losing my mind
I'm going crazy in this big, white room of mine
I'm going crazy, yeah, I'm losing my mind
I'm going crazy in this big, white room of mine
Sitting in a big white room alone
Close the door, don't want the pain to come in, no
I clench my fist and try to stay strong, I cry, I feel sick
My heart's beating, b-b-beating, beating out of control
Can I run, run faster than you? I wanna feel my body again
Feel the wind in my hair
But I have to stay in this big, white room
'Cause no one else cares, no, no, no, no, no, n-n-no, no
I'm going crazy, yeah, I'm losing my mind
I'm going crazy in this big, white room of mine
I'm going crazy, I'm losing my mind
I'm going crazy in this big, white room of mine
Everybody's looking at me, everybody's staring at me
What do I do now? Smile, yeah, yeah
Everybody's looking at me, everybody's staring at me
What do I do now? Smile, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
I'm going crazy, I'm losing my mind
I'm going crazy in this big, white room of mine
I'm going cra-c-c-crazy, I'm losing my mind
I'm going crazy in this big, white room of mine
I'm going crazy, I'm losing my mind
I'm going crazy in this big, white room of mine
