I hope tomorrow will bring better you, better me
I know that well show this world we got more we could be
So you should never give up on your hopes and your dreams
You gotta get up, get out, get into it, get it on to be strong
If we try we can fly to a whole another place
All we need is relief and a smile on our face
We can go anywhere we want, any road we decide to take
And were never, never, never too far from tomorrow, today
If tomorrow is light in a place where theres no home
Then know that now is the time to have faith in us all
You know were all in this world and we all can belong
We gotta get up, get out, get over it, get it on to be strong
If we try we can fly to a place in the sun
All we need is precious dreams and a friend we can trust
We can go anywhere we want, any road we can take
And were never too far from tomorrow, today
Everybody say tomorrow is just for us to share
And were gonna send our message of love out everywhere
Theres a promise of love tomorrow has
Something special and its something we know will last and last
Cause were never far away, never
One thing I can always be sure of
Far away, no never
The promise of today
