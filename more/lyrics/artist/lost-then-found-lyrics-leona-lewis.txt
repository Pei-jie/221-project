Staring at tears on the pages
Of letters that I never could've write
Now I know love isn't painless,
but it's worth the risk,
it's worth the fight
Playing it over and over
I wish that I could turn back time, baby
We were wrong, but we could be right
Why do we say things we can't take back
Why do we miss what we never had
Both of us fell to the ground
The love was so lost, it couldn't be found
What would it take to forget who's blamed?
I'm tired of crying out at the sound of your name
Why don't we turn this around, love ain't the enemy
Don't you want to be lost then found
Lost then found, lost then found
Love ain't the enemy
We could be lost then found
Empty glasses on tables, echoes fill these rooms
The memories go where we go,
They're like the suitcase that you never lose
If the good lords eyes upon me
I swear to make things right
Whatever we lost, i know we can find
Why do we say things we can't take back
Why do we miss what we never had
Both of us fell to the ground
The love was so lost, it couldn't be found
What would it take to forget who's blamed?
I'm tired of crying out at the sound of your name
Why don't we turn this around, love ain't the enemy
Don't you want to be lost then found
No words can come without
Can't stop the rain, I wish you could take it back
But it's too late, it's too late
Why do we say things we can't take back
Why do we miss what we never had
Both of us fell to the ground
The love was so lost, it couldn't be found
What would it take to forget who's blamed?
I'm tired of crying out at the sound of your name
Why don't we turn this around, love ain't the enemy
Don't you want to be lost then found
Lost then found, lost then found
Love ain't the enemy
We could be lost then found
No words can come without
Can't stop the rain,(Lost then found)
I wish you could take it back (Lost then found)
But it's too late, it's too late
We could be lost then found..
