Yes, I can see her
'Cause every girl in here wanna be her
Oh, she's a diva
I feel the same and I wanna meet her
They say she low down
It's just a rumor and I don't believe 'em
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town
She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen before
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl
Without being disrespectful
The way that booty movin' I can't take no more
Have to stop what I'm doin' so I can pull her close
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl
Without being disrespectful
Damn girl
Damn, you's a sexy chick
A sexy chick
Damn, you's a sexy chick
