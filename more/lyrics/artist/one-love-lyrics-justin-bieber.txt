Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wont let the night stand in my way
I know what I want, I know what I get, yeah
Im only here to find you, you
All I need is you by my side
All I wanna do is lay down next to you
Cause I all I need is one love, one love, one heart
Cause I all I need is one love, one love, one heart
Baby give it to me
Cause I dont want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody has got what I need
Cause I dont want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody has got what I need tonight
See Ive made mistakes time after time, time, time
But no not today, wont leave 'til I find what Im looking for
Im only here to find you, you
All I need is you by my side
All I wanna do is dance under the moon
Cause I all I need is one love, one love, one heart
Cause I all I need is one love, one love, one heart
Baby give it to me
Cause I dont want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody has got what I need
Cause I dont want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody has got what I need tonight
Your love is like a roller-coaster
The way that you take my breath away
It feels like Im slowly falling deeper and deeper, deeper and deeper
Cause I all I need is one love, one love, one heart
Cause I all I need is one love, one love, one heart
Baby give it to me
Cause I dont want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody has got what I need
Cause I dont want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody can give it to me
Cause I dont want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody has got what I need
Cause I dont want-want nobody when I got-got your body
Baby no no nobody has got what I need tonight.
