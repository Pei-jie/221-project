You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving I think way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
You say I've known you longer, my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other
Think we'd never match at all
But we do-oo, but we do do do do, but we do-oo, but we do do do do do do do n doot
I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more
I've never known this, never before
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
Don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining
You think we wouldn't we do-oo
But we do do do do, but we do-oo, but we do do do do do do do n doot
Favoritism ain't my thing but
(In this situation), in the situation I'll be glad
Favoritism ain't my thing but
(In this situation), I'll be glad to make an exception
Whoa... whoa...
You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving I think way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
You say I've known you longer, my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other
Think we'll never match at all
But we do
Ooh...
