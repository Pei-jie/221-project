rock
Up rolled the riot van
And sparked excitement in the boys
But the policemen look annoyed
Perhaps these are ones they should avoid
They got a chase last night
From men with truncheons dressed in hats
They didnt do that much wrong
Still ran away though for the laugh
Just for the laugh
Please just stop talking
Because they wont find us if you do
Oh those silly boys in blue
Well they wont catch me and you
Have you been drinking son, you dont look old enough to me
Im sorry officer is there a certain age youre supposed to be?
'Cause nobody told me
And up rolled the riot van
And these lads just wind the coppers up
They ask why they dont catch proper crooks
They get their address and their names took
But they couldnt care less
Thrown in the riot van
And all the coppers kicked him in
And there was no way he could win
Just had to take it on the chin
