I fell picture perfect
On and off the shelf to a broken frame of mind
A broken frame of mind
It comes back and haunts me
A bullet under cover, it fooled me every time
Fooled me every time
But even if I lose it all
I got so much left to give; I wont give up, no
My heart is on the front line, Im not afraid
I will love you, like Ive never been hurt
Run through fire for you, like Ive never been burned
Im gonna risk it all like Ive never lost
Gonna give it all Ive got
I will love you; I will love, like Ive never been hurt
Never been hurt
You set fire to ashes,
You fought through the darkness,
And brought me back to life
You brought me back to life
But even if I lose it all
I got so much left to give, I wont give up
My heart is on the frontline, not afraid
I will love you, like Ive never been hurt
Run through fire for you, like Ive never been burned
Im gonna risk it all like Ive never lost
Gonna give it all Ive got
I will love you; I will love, like Ive never been hurt
Never been hurt
I will love you and forever,
I will love you like I never
Like I never heard goodbye
Like I never heard a lie
Like Im falling into love for the first time
I will love you, like Ive never been hurt
Run through fire for you, like Ive never been burned
Im gonna risk it all like Ive never lost
Gonna give it all Ive got
I will love you; I will love, like Ive never been hurt
Never been hurt
