(Ride)
When we ride, we ride, it's till the day that we die
(We die)
When we ride, we ride, it's till the day that we die
It's real late about quarter to one
I'm thinking of everything what we've become
And I hate it, I thought we could make it
But I'm ready to jet this, just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures in the letters she sent
You had me thinkin' you were out with your friends
I'm so foolish, playin' me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I, oh
Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy right now you got me breakin' down
And I just can't figure out why but this is what you said
(We ride)
When we ride, we ride, it's till the day that we die
(Till we die)
We used to say
When we ride, we ride, it's till the day that we die
(We ride)
When we ride, we ride, it's till the day that we die
(Till we die)
Boy I remember what you used to say
When we ride, we ride, it's till the day that we die
Visions in my mind of the day that we met
You showed me things that I'll never forget
Took me swimmin' in the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating, yeah
You think I'm playin' when you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses and my lovin'
But ain't nobody better than us, yeah yeah
Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy right now you got me breakin' down
And I just can't figure out why you said
(We ride)
When we ride, we ride, it's till the day that we die
(Till we die)
We used to say
When we ride, we ride, it's till the day that we die
(We ride)
When we ride, we ride, it's till the day that we die
(Till we die)
Boy I remember what you used to say
When we ride, we ride, it's till the day that we die
I guess it's over indefinitely
But you and I know it's not that easy
To let go of everything that we planned
And start all over again, hey
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it, my sweet baby
This is where the game ends now
But somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out
(We ride)
When we ride, we ride, it's till the day that we die
(Till we die)
When we ride, we ride, it's till the day that we die
Wanna make you say boy
I wish that you could hold me when I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to you would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride, we ride, it's till the day that we die)
Boy, you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(When we ride, we ride, it's till the day that we die)
(We ride)
When we ride, we ride, it's till the day that we die
(Till we die)
We used to say
When we ride, we ride, it's till the day that we die
(We ride)
When we ride, we ride, it's till the day that we die
(Till we die)
Boy I remember what you used to say
When we ride, we ride, it's till the day that we die
(We ride)
