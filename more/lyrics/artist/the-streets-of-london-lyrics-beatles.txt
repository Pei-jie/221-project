Beatles
rock
Have you seen the old man in the closed down market,
kicking up the paper with worn out shoes ?
In his eyes you see no pride, and held loosely at his side,
Yesterday's paper telling yesterday's news.
Refrain:
So how can you tell me you're lonely, and say, for you that the sun don't shine ?
Let me take you by the hand and lead you though the streets of London,
I'll show you something to make you change your mind.
Have you seen the old girl who walks to the streets of London,
dirt in her hair and her clothes just in rags?
She's no time for talking, she just keeps right on walking,
Carrying here home in two carrier bags
Refrain:
So how can you tell me you're lonely, and say, for you that the sun don't shine ?
Let me take you by the hand and lead you though the streets of London,
I'll show you something to make you change your mind.
In the all-night cafe at a quarter past eleven,
same old man sitting there on his ownLooking at the world over the rim of him tea-cup,
Each tea lasts an hour, then he wanders home alone.
Refrain:
So how can you tell me you're lonely, and say, for you that the sun don't shine ?
Let me take you by the hand and lead you though the streets of London,
I'll show you something to make you change your mind.
