(Tim McGraw) - Bet your windows rolled down and your hair's pulled back, and I betcha' got no idea you're going way too fast.
You're tryin' not to think about what went wrong, you're tryin' not to stop till you get where you're going.
You're trying to stay awake so I bet you turned on the radio, and the song goes...
(Taylor Swift) - I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby.
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, Oh baby.
(Tim McGraw) - The highway won't hold you tonight, the highway don't know you're alive. The highway don't care if you're all alone, but I do, I do.
The highway won't try your tears, the highway don't need you here, the highway don't care if you're coming home. But I do, I do.
(Tim/Taylor) - I betcha' got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat. Yeah, I bet you're bendin' God's ear talkin' bout' me.
You're tryin' not to let the first tear fall out. You're tryin' not to think about turning around, You're tryin' not to get lost in the sound.
(Tim McGraw) - That song is always on so you sing along.
(Taylor Swift) - I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby.
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, Oh baby.
(Tim McGraw) - The highway won't hold you tonight, the highway don't know you're alive. The highway don't care if you're all alone, but I do, I do.
The highway won't try your tears, the highway don't need you here, the highway don't care if you're coming home. But I do, I do.
