1,2,3,4,5 years go by
I don't really know why, I don't really know why
7,8,9,11 years go by
I don't really know why, I don't really know why
I still feel the same way I did when I was 17
I still look over my shoulder waiting for the world to change
But these are the good old days
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
And I think I'd like to stay
Oh, I'd like to stay
1,2,3,4,5 years ago I didn't see a belly
With a child on the inside
6,7,8,10 years ago if I only knew about the love
I only knew about the fight
I look back and I realize all those times I was lonely
Praying for someday to hurry up and come and save me
But these are the good old days
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
And I wish that I could stay
Oh, I wish that I could stay
I wish I could stay
And the moment you let go the faster the time goes
The darker the night is the lighter the moon glows
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
1,2,3,4,5 years from now I hope I'm still getting down
Hope I'm still around
But 6,7,8,10 beers ago I had a revelation
All's well right now
It's all good right now
It's all good right now
It's all good right now
(x3)
But these are the good old days
These are the good old days
These are the good old days
And I wish that I could stay
