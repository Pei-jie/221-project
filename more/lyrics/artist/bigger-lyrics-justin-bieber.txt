The love the love is
Bigger
The love the love is

Gotta believe in me (gotta believe in me)
Believe it like a fairy-tale
put a tooth under your pillowcase
No I won't, I won't
Ever ever let you down (No)
Like a Seasaw lets you down (oh)
You know why
Cuz we ain't on the playground no more baby
We're big enough
stand in the picture
We're big enough
stand next to love
I was a player
when I was little
but I'm bigger
I'm bigger
A heart-breaker
when I was little
but I'm bigger
I'm bigger
And all the haters
I swear they're so small from up here
Cuz we're bigger,
and love's bigger
I'm bigger and you're bigger.
Whoa oh
remember when my heart was young
It was still bigger than me (bigger than me)
Is that the reason that you stayed
Most would've got rid of me
Now the bullies in the school yard
Can't take our hugs and our kisses from us (No!)
Because we ain't push-overs no more, baby
We're big enough
stand in the picture
We're big enough
stand next to love
I was a player
when I was little
but I'm bigger
I'm bigger
A heart-breaker
when I was little
but I'm bigger
I'm bigger
And all the haters
I swear they're so small from up here
Cuz we're bigger,
and love's bigger,
I'm bigger and you're bigger
I was a player
when I was little
but I'm bigger
I'm bigger
A heart-breaker
when I was little
but I'm bigger
I'm bigger
And all the haters
I swear they look so small from up here
Cuz we're bigger,
and love's bigger,
I'm bigger and you're bigger
(Remember those stroll down street) I remember that
(Don't knock ya earrings) Like Yesterday
(They shine on me) They were little then
(In class I dreamed about you) My baby
You wow wow (You wow wow)
Since then all I can remember is the love only got Bigga
I was a player
when I was little
but I'm bigger
I'm bigger
A heart-breaker
when I was little
but I'm bigger
I'm bigger
And all the haters
I swear they're so small from up here
Cuz we're biger,
and love's bigger,
I'm bigger and you're bigger
I was a player
when I was little
but I'm bigger
I'm bigger
A heart-breaker
when I was little
but I'm bigger
I'm bigger
And all the haters
I swear they're so small from up here
Cuz we're bigger,
and love's bigger,
I'm bigger and you're bigger.
