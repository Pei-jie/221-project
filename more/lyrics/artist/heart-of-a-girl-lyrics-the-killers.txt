Looking at my window,
An angel in robes appeared and nearly pulled me apart,
A million miles of freedom,
A million miles of road,
But I still dont know where to start.
She wrote her number down and she gave it to me,
They had to scrape me off the floor,
In this transient town,
Waiters and dealers trying to get their foot in the door.
That night I called her and she said,
Daddy, daddy, daddy, all my life, Ive been trying to find my place in this world.
I said to her, Baby baby, babe,
Ive got all night to listen to the heart of a girl.
I can see the time dripping down the clock.
Weve been trying to hear that ancient refrain.
Its the one that knows us when our heads are down,
And reminds us of the place from where we came.
Where we came
Daddy, daddy, daddy,
All my life, Ive been trying to find my place in this world.
Baby, baby, babe, Ive got all night,
To listen to the heart of a girl.
What happened here?
What is this world?
Its too far from the heart of a girl.
A ripple in the water from the drop of a pearl,
Im on the shore waiting for the heart of a girl.
Many doors,
Knock on one,
Standing still,
Time is raging,
Staring down the mouth of a hundred thousand guns,
And youre still here,
Youre still here.
I believe that we never have to be alone,
Yes, I believe,
Its just around the bend,
You can hold it in or scream it on a microphone,
There is no end,
(There is no end)
There is no end,
(There is no end).
(Come on)
Deep in the night,
I feel the presence of something that was long ago told to me.
There is a hand guiding the river,
The river to wide open sea.
And deep in my heart,
In any game,
On any mountain,
Oh Im not afraid,
Standing on stone,
You stand beside me,
And honor the plans that were made.
