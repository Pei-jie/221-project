Liam:
Been a lot of places
I've been all around the world
Seen a lot of faces
Never knowing where I was
On the horizon
Hm but I know, I know, I know, I know
The sun will be rising back home
Niall:
Living out the cases
Packing up and taking off
Made a lot of changes
But not forgetting who I was
On the horizon
Hm and I know, I know, I know, I know
The moon will be rising back home
All:
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
And the proof is in this song
Harry:
I've been away for ages
But I got everything I need
I'm flipping through the pages
I've written in my memory
I feel like I'm dreaming
Oh, so I know, I know, I know, I know
That I'm never leaving
No, I won't go
All:
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
And the proof is in this song
Louis:
Lights up
And they should be on
Even stars in the sky they're wrong
Zayn:
Short days where the nights are long
When I think of the days I'm gone
Don't matter how far I'm gone
I'm always feeling like home
All:
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
Never, never, never
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
And the proof is in this song
Oh, don't forget it
Oh, If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
And the proof is in this song
Never forget it this song
Don't forget it
No one never forget it this song
You were neverâ€¦
