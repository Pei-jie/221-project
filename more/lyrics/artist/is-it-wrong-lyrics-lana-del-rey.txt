pop
I guess it's symptomatic of this slight infatuation
Stalking you has sorta become like my occupation
Used to be a beauty queen with simple acquisitions
Met my local rock star now I'm having visions
I fell for you, you like me too
Lets get it on check 1, 2
I fell for you, you want me too
Let's get it on
Is it wrong? Is it wrong?
Making out with you
While you're singing your song
Is it wrong? Is it wrong?
You're playing your guitar and it's turning me on
You got your eye liner, long hair
Walking round like you don't care
You got me in the back of your car, like a star
Is it wrong? Is it wrong?
If it's wrong I don't wanna be right
I get so systematic in this kinda situation
I need it, have to have it to take over domination
Used to be so simple, never wanting never wishing
Now I'm hooked on fame and I'm a girl on a mission
I fell for you, it's all for you
Let's get it on check 1, 2
I fall for you, it's all for you
Let's get it on
Is it wrong? Is it wrong?
Making out with you
While you're singing your song
Is it wrong? Is it wrong?
You're playing your guitar and it's turning me on
You got your eye liner, long hair
Walking round like you don't care
You got me in the back of your car, like a star
Is it wrong? Is it wrong?
If it's wrong I don't wanna be right
The funny little thing about love
Is that you're blind all the time
And even when you think you had enough
You're wanting more it isn't right
But you can't stop
You got your eye liner, long hair
Walking round like you don't care
You got me in the back of your car
You got your eye liner, long hair
Walking round like you don't care
You got me in the back of your car
Is it wrong? Is it wrong?
If it's wrong I don't wanna be right
