A shot in the dark
A past lost in space
Where do I start?
The past and the chase?
You hunted me down
Like a wolf, a predator
I felt like a deer in your lights
You loved me and I froze in time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
But I can't compete with the she wolf, who has brought me to my knees
What do you see in those yellow eyes
Cause I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces
[beat break]
Did she lie and wait
Was I bait to pull you in
The thrill of the kill
You feel, as a sin
Lay with the wolves
Alone, it seems
I thought I was part of you
You loved me and I froze in time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
But I can't compete with the she wolf
Who has brought me to my knees
What do you see in those yellow eyes
Cause i'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces
[beat break]
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces
