1st verse:
Came in tonight,
Knew I would see you,
But I, Wasnt quite ready for it (no),
These feelings I cant ignore ('cause),
The two of us are over,
But Im not sure if Im over you,
Baby I, made a mistake,
When I up and walked away, Now
CHORUS:
I wish I had one more chance,
One more chance to tell you, Baby I know better, cause now i see that you are the girl(one more chance),
One more chance to show you,
How much I still love you,
Too bad love is over, 'cause I wish I had one,
2nd:
One more night,
To talk late on the phone,
(One more), One more smiley face,
Like the ones that you put on the bottom of your notes(OH),one more touch,one more hug
(Dont even talk about a kiss),
I cant help but reminisce 'cause,
CHORUS x2
3rd:
Baby oh baby I know I stated we needed some time apart,
But what I see in you has got me on a mission, Im just wishin,
Maybe just maybe youll realize and youll let me back in your heart,
Im at your mercy, Ooh girl I wish I had oneeeee,
CHORUS
