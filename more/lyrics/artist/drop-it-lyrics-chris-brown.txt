[Chorus]:
D-d-d-d-drop, drop, drop it, drop it, drop it to the ground
Drop, drop, drop it, drop it down (drop it down)
D-d-d-d-drop, drop, drop it, drop it, drop it to the ground
Drop, drop, drop it, drop it down (drop it down)
Take it off and take it slow, that's just the way it goes
Drop it down to the ground, were dancing all around
Hear the music turn it loud, play it, play it right now
DJ plays my favorite song, everyone sing along, yeah.
[Chorus]
