I know a lotta niggas in here probably hate me right now
Girl, I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that
That ain't gon' change a thing, still gon' do my thing
I'm still, still gon' go get mine
Still gon' keep on winning
Still gon' keep it 100 every time
I'm still, I'm still
Even when them nigga throw shots (bang, bang)
I'm still, I'm still
Still gon' end up on top
I'm still...
[Verse 1]
(Pussy ass niggas stop hating)
You niggas mad cause you fucking with them regular hoes
And ain't none better than my asian
Hold up, wait, nigga fucking with my patience
Cause I'm that nigga, give a fuck about a racist
If I gotta pull the trigger, I'mma kill a nigga
I'll even pay for the funeral arrangements
I'mma fuck your baby mama, she gon' take dick
And when your kids see Chris they gon' take pics
I'm number one in the life cause I make hits
These real diamonds, yours hollywood fake shit
If you trip, banana clip
This shit'll make a nigga fucking go ape shit
I'm 24, yeah, a nigga getting older
Don't give a fucking my heart getting colder
Now every nigga in the industry done fucked my bitch
And all my niggas said: "I told ya"
Now all these rap niggas wanna be political
Fuck that, nigga I'm a real lyrical killer
Spit sick, shit, get a cold
Who the fuck you think your bitch is cooking dinner for?
A couple months with your girl and bitch is on a centrefold
Seven days of the week, I got ten of those
And then I pass it to the homies
They gon' bang, bang, run a train
Yeah nigga cause she been a ho
