Anticipation has the habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment but
Tonight therell be some love
Tonight therell be a ruckus, yeah regardless of whats gone before
I want to see all of the things that weve already seen
The lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
And of course it's fancy dress
And theyre all looking quite full on
In bunny ears and devil horns in hell
Anticipation has the habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment but
Tonight therell be some love
Tonight therell be a ruckus, yeah regardless of whats gone before
I want to see all of the things that weve already seen
I want to see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine
And put it all back in
Youve got to understand it you can never beat the bandit, no
And she wont be surprised and she won't be shocked
When shes pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
And theres verse and chapter sat in her inbox
And all that it says is that youve drank a lot
And you should bear that in mind tonight
Bear that in mind
Yeah you should bear that in mind tonight
Bear that in mind
And you can pour your heart out
But her reasoning will block
Or you send her after nine o clock
Anticipation has the habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment but
Tonight therell be some love, oh
Tonight therell be a ruckus, yeah regardless of whats gone before
And she wont be surprised and she won't be shocked
When shes pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
And theres verse and chapter sat in her inbox
And all that it says is that youve drank a lot
And you should bear that in mind tonight
Bear that in mind
Yeah you should bear that in mind tonight
Bear that in mind
And you can pour your heart out around 3 o'clock
When the 2 for 1s undone the writer's block
