I stared up at the sun
Thought of all the people,
places and things I've loved
I stared up just to see
Of all the faces,
you were the one next to me
You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea
You can see your life out of the window, tonight
If I lose myself tonight
It'll be by your side
If I lose myself tonight
woooh, woooh, woooh!
If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I
Lose myself tonight
I woke up with the sun
Thought of all the people
Places and things
I've loved
I woke up just to see
With all of the faces
You are the one next to me
You can feel the light
Start to tremble
Washing what you know
Out to sea
You can see your life
Out the window
Tonight
If I lose myself tonight
It'll be by your side
If I lose myself tonight
woooh, woooh, woooh!
If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I
Lose myself tonight
woooh, woooh, woooh!
Take us down
We keep trying
Forty thousand feet
keep flying
Take us down
we keep trying
forty thousand feet
keep flying
Take us down
We keep trying
Forty thousand feet
keep flying
Take us down
we keep trying
forty thousand feet
keep flying
If I lose myself yeeeehhh
If I lose myself tonight
Whoooo, whoooo...
Whooo whooo
