Beatles
rock
They're really rocking in Boston,
in Philadelphia PA,
deep in the heart of Texas,
on down the Frisco Bay.
All over Saint Louis
and down in New Orleans.
All the cats want to dance with
sweet little sixteen.
Sweet little sixteen,
she's just got to have
about half a million
framed autopraphs.
Her wall is filled with pictures,
she gets them one by one.
Becomes so excited,
oh watch her at the run boy.
Oh mommy mommy,
please may I go.
You know it's such a sight to see
somebody steal the show.
Oh daddy daddy,
I beg of you.
Please say it to mommy
it's alright with you.
Sweet little sixteen
she's got the grown up blues.
Tight dresses and lipstick,
she's sporting in high heeled boots.
Oh but tomorrow morning
she'll have to change her trend
become sweet sixteen
and back in class again.
They're really rocking in Boston,
in Philadelphia PA,
deep in the heart of Texas
and down the Frisco Bay.
All over Saint Louis,
on down in New Orleans.
All the cats want to dance with
sweet little sixteen.
