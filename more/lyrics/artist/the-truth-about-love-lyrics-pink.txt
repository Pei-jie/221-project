The truth about love
comes at 3 am
you wake up fucked up
and you grab a pen
And you say to yourself
I'm gonna figure it out
I'm gonna crack that code
Gonna break it, break it down
I'm tired of all these questions
and, now it's just annoying 'cause
No one has the answers
So I guess it's up to me to find
The truth about love
is it comes and it goes
a strange fascination
it is lips on toes
Morning breath, bedroom eyes
on a smiling face
Sheets marks rug burn
and a sugar glaze
the shock and the awe
that can eat you raw
is the truth about love
(the truth about love)
I think you just may be perfect
you're the person of my dreams
I've never ever ever ever ever been this happy
But now something has changed
And the truth about love
is it's all a lie
I thought you were the one
and I hate goodbyes
Oh you want the truth?
The truth about love
is it's nasty and it's salty
It's the regret in the morning
It's the smelling of armpits
It's wings and songs
and trees and birds
It's all the poetry that you ever heard
Terror coup d'e'tat life line forget-me-nots
It's the hunt and the kill
the schemes and the plots
The truth about love is
it's blood and it's guts
purebreds and mutts,
sandwiches without the crust
It takes your breath 'cause
it leaves a scar
But those untouched
never got, never got very far
It's rage and it's hate
and a sick twist of fate
And that's the truth about love
(the truth about love)
I think you just may be perfect
You're the person of my dreams
I've never ever ever ever ever been this happy
But now something has changed
and the truth about love is
it's all a lie
I thought you were the one
and I hate goodbyes
Oh you can lose your breath and
Oh you can shoot a gun and
Convinced you're the only one
that's ever felt this way before
it hurts inside the hurt within and
it folds together pocket thin and
it's whispered by the angels lips and
it can turn you into a son-of-a-bitch man
The truth, the truth, the truth about love is
truth, the truth, the truth about love is
I think you just may be perfect
You're the person of my dreams
I've never ever ever ever ever been this happy
But now something has changed
and the truth about love is
it's all a lie
I thought you were the one
and i hate goodbyes
I think you just may be perfect
You're the person of my dreams
I've never ever ever ever been this happy
But now something has changed
and the truth about love is
it's all a lie
I thought you were the one
and I hate goodbyes
The truth about love
