[Nicki Minaj]
Chimpanzee's is hatin' , but I take it all in stride
Put her in a jungle with bananas on the side
Told you they'd revive your career, but somebody lied
I aint talking poultry when I say this chicken's friiiiiiiiiiiiied
Anyway Britney, why they so jealous that you teamed up with me
Tell 'em they my sons, yup, gal dem a' me pitney
Anyway, brembedell , whats that, I don't know but, femme fatale
Sniff, sniff, cryyyyy, I done slayed your whole entire fucking lifeeeeee
Oh oh, you got some Epson Salt
I done balled all day you aint left the court
What, what you tired, you need a break
You was hot when? Ricki Lake!
