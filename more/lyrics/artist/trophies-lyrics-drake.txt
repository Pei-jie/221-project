Drake
hiphop
Got hit records on my demoAnnotate
Did y'all boys not get the memo
I do not stay at the intercontinental
And anything I got is not a rental
I own it mothaf*cka
Figured out this sh*t, it's simple
My stock be going up like a crescendo
A buncha handshakes from the fakes
But n*gga I do not want to be friends though
I told y'all motherf*ckers
Man this sh*t is not a love song
This is a f*ck a stripper on a ... song
This a f*ck them boys forever, hold a grudge song
Pop some f*ckin' champagne and a tux on
N*gga, "just because" song
