Lay me down covered with nothing but your duvet on,
we could be in love if love was a reality.
Take me down to where your heart and where your soul came from,
and we can fall in love cause love is only gravity.
I fell in love with a chick who's a no go,
running around the town like an old bloke.
Where back out cause you know though,
we used to be so solid oh no.
Everybody in the scene risked it,
deep down i dont know how i coulda missed it.
If the balls in your court and she swings by,
then your the one that hits it.
I dont know if we'll make it now,
she dont know so ima break it down.
Every time that im lying down,
shes out there getting bossed around.
She dont know if we'll make it know,
oh look your naked now.
Even though i like your smile,
this is the last time ill take it down.
Lay me down covered with nothing but your duvet on,
we could be in love if love was a reality.
Take me down to where your heart and where your soul came from,
and we can fall in love cause love is only gravity.
Look now im back where i started,
running around the town pissed off.
Angel see you got what you came for,
then like canerow parted.
I aint scared of your boo-tay,
just see you in a new way.
I dont care what you dude say just get out my duvet.
I dont know if we'll make it now,
she dont know so ima break it down.
Every time that im lying down,
shes out there getting passed around.
She dont know if we'll make it know,
oh look your naked now.
Even though i like your smile,
this is the last time il take it down.
Lay me down covered with nothing but your duvet on,
we could be in love if love was a reality.
Take me down to where your heart and where your soul came from,
and we can fall in love cause love is only gravity.
Its not what you are doing,
its not what you have done.
Its more that im persuing,
but you are only one.
Lay me down covered with nothing but your duvet on,
we could be in love if love was a reality.
Take me down to where your heart and where your soul came from,
and we can fall in love cause love is only gravity.
