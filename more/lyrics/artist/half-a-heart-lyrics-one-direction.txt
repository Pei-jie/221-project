Liam:
So your friend's been telling me
You've been sleeping with my sweater
And that you can't stop missing me
Bet my friend's been telling you
I'm not doing much better
'Cause I'm missing half of me
Zayn:
And being here without you
Is like I'm waking up to
Only half a blue sky
Kinda there- but not quite
I'm walking 'round with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man- at best
With half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you
Louis:
Forget all we said that night
No, it doesn't even matter
'Cause we both got split in two
Zayn:
If you could spare an hour or so
We'll go for lunch down by the river
We can really talk it through
Harry and Louis:
And being here without you
Is like I'm waking up to
Harry and Niall:
Only half a blue sky
Kinda there- but not quite
I'm walking 'round with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man- at best
With half an arrow in my chest
'cause I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you
Half a heart without you
I'm half a heart without you
Niall:
Though I try to getcha outta my head
The truth is I got lost without you
Since then I've been waking up to
All:
Only half a blue sky
Kinda there- but not quite
I'm walking 'round with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man- at best
With half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
Harry:
I'm half a heart without you
