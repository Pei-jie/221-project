Uh oh oh oh
Uh Oh Oh
Everyone's waiting on the bell
(on the bell)
A Couple seconds we'll be raising hell
(raising hell)
The sun is shining down
School is finally out
Nothing matters so we might as well
(Might as well)
Everybody's bakin' in the sun
Come and party, do it while we're young
Move your body when you hear the drums
So put your hands up
It's gonna be a bitchin' summer
We'll be living fast, kicking ass together
Like high school lovebirds
Gonna have a blast, make it last forever
I'll pick you up at the liquor store
Hurry up we can fit one more
It's now or never
It's gonna gonna be be , a bitchin' summer
Uh oh oh oh
Uh oh oh a bitchin summer
uh oh oh oh
uh oh oh a bitchin summer
Throwing empty bottles in the fire
(in the fire)
Whiskeys got us singing like a choir
(like a choir)
We're all gonna run
When the police come
But in the morning we are so alive
(so alive)
Everybody's bakin' in the sun
Come and party, do it while we're young
Move your body when you hear the drums
So put your hands up
It's gonna be a bitchin' summer
We'll be living fast, kicking ass together
Like high school lovebirds
Gonna have a blast, make it last forever
I'll pick you up at the liquor store
Hurry up we can fit one more
It's now or never
It's gonna gonna be be , a bitchin' summer
Uh oh oh oh oh
Uh oh oh a bitchin summer
uh oh oh oh oh
uh oh oh a bitchin summer
Right right near the beach
The party dont stop
If we dont get harassed by the motherfuckin' cops
A quarter tank of gas
About a half of pack
My cell phones dying but theres no turning back
I can feel the breeze
Steerin' with my knee
Drumming on my dashboard
Bumping to the beat
Hit the windsheild wiper
Searching for my lighter
I gotta get right before this all nighter
It's gonna be a bitchin' summer
We'll be living fast, kicking ass together
Like high school lovebirds
Gonna have a blast, make it last forever
I'll pick you up at the liquor store
Hurry up we can fit one more
It's now or never
It's gonna gonna be be, a bitchin' summer
Uh oh oh oh (hey)
Uh oh oh a bitchin' summer
uh oh oh oh (hey)
uh oh oh a bitchin' summer
Pick you up at the liquor store
Hurry up we can fit one more
It's now or never
It's gonna gonna be be, a bitchin' summer
