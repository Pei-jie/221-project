You look in my eyes and I get emotional inside
I know its crazy but you still can touch my heart
And after all this time you think that I wouldnt feel the same
But time melts into nothing and nothing's changed
I still believe
Someday you and me will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
Someday you and me will find ourselves In love again
Each day of my life, Im filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I, I am not the desperate type
If theres one spark of hope left in my grasp Ill hold it with both hands
Its worth the risk of burning to have a second chance
No, no, no, no, no, no, I need you, baby
I still believe that we can be together, no, no, no
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again
I still believe
Someday you and me will find ourselves in love again
(Oh, baby, yeah, yeah)
I had a dream
You and me will find ourselves in love again
I still believe
Someday you and me
(Ooh, baby, I do)
(Just give me one more try)
In love again
I had a dream
(I miss your love)
(Someday you and me)
Will find ourselves In love again
I still believe
Someday you and me will find ourselves in love again
