People come, people go
But your touch cuts me deeper
And still it grows at the center
I will always remember
Years gone by, seems like you're still here
Every night in my dreams
You remind me with kisses so tender
I will always remember
Never been one to give my heart up so easily
But now you're gone
Wish I'd given my heart completely
In the touch of a stranger, I can feel you
In the eyes of a child, I see your face
Your hold on my soul keeps me from danger
No matter how hard I try
These memories, I can't erase
People come, people go
But your touch cuts me deeper
And still it grows at the center
I will always remember
Years gone by, seems like you're still here
Every night in my dreams
You remind me with kisses so tender
I will always remember
People, people
People, people
In the brush of a stranger, I can feel you
In the eyes of a child, I see your face
Your hold on my soul keeps me from danger
No matter how hard I try, these memories
I can't replace, can't replace
People come, people go
But your touch cuts me deeper
And still it grows at the center
I will always remember
Years gone by, seems like you're still here
Every night in my dreams
You remind me with kisses so tender
I will always remember
I'll always remember
People, people
People, people
People come, people go
But your touch cuts me deeper
And still it grows at the center
I will always remember
