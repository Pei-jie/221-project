Up in the morning,
up in the evening,
Picking down talks when the birds get back to me.
Oh, to me.
Up on the mountain,
down in the king's lair,
pushing these boxes in the heat of the afternoon.
Oh, afternoon.
We were never welcome here,
we were never welcome here at all.
Noooooooooooo.
It's who we are.
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.
Doesn't matter if it's not okay.
Save us,
what we are,
don't look clear,
it's all uphill from here.
Oohhhhhhhhhh.
Up in the attic,
down in the cellar,
lost in a static,
coming back for more.
Oh, for more.
Out with the reason,
in with the season,
taking down names in my book of jealousy.
Jealousy.
We were never welcome here.
We were never welcome here at all.
Noooooooooooo.
It's who we are.
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.
Doesn't matter if it's not okay.
Because it's who we are.
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.
Doesn't matter if it's not okay.
Save us,
what we are,
don't look clear,
it's all uphill from here.
Oohhhhhhhhhh.
They say we're crazy.
They say we're crazy.
They say we're crazy.
They say we're crazy.
They say we're crazy.
They say we're crazy.
THEY SAY WE'RE CRAZY.
THEY SAY WE'RE, CRAZY.
It's who we are.
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.
Doesn't matter if it's not okay.
Because it's who we are.
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.
Doesn't matter if it's not okay.
Save us,
what we are,
don't look clear,
it's all uphill from here.
Oohhhhhhhhhh.
(They say we're crazy.
They say we're crazy.)
