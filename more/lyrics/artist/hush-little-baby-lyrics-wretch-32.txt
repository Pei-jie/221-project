Hush little baby
Don't you cry
I said hush little baby
Don't you cry
No
I said hush little baby
Don't you cry
I'm saying hush little baby
Don't you cry
Daddy ain't sure he can raise you right
I ain't even good with saving my money
Why should I think I could save your life
The whole family's gonna think I'm a devil
Cah I don't want to see my angels eyes
I say this with one hand on my heart
Guilt ain't gonna make me change my mind
My first thoughts were my worst thoughts
Running round my head in circles
The world's gonna hate me for saying this
But patience is a virtue
So we don't have to rush
For our first yute
We could take time do rehearsals
And I ain't acting, this is personal
And I ain't doing this just to hurt you
[Chorus]
I should say goodbye before I say hello
So darling hold me closely tonight
Cos' if you open your eyes I'll never let you go
Moving slowly we'll both sleep tonight
And I'll be dreaming till you wake me up
When I'm telling her about raving
She's telling me about cravings
I want her tojust get the message
I don't want to have to be so blatant
So I told her my life ain't balanced yeah
So the time ain't right
She said God's clocks the only one that matters
And it's about time I tried
Yeah and if I listen to my family
Then I'll be a new addition to my family
I can't help feeling peer pressured
Everyone's looking down but
They don't understand me
Yeah and everyone's so suggestive
I'm getting mixed messages
But nobody's rang me huh
I ain't saying this is a game
But when I say the wrong thing
Everybody wants to hang me
[Chorus]
I should say goodbye before I say hello
So darling hold me closely tonight
Cos' if you open your eyes I'll never let you go
Moving slowly we'll both sleep tonight
And I'll be dreaming till you wake me up
I said hush little baby
Don't you cry
I said hush little baby
Don't you cry
No
I said hush little baby
Don't you cry
[Chorus]
I should say goodbye before I say hello
So darling hold me closely tonight
Cos' if you open your eyes I'll never let you go
Moving slowly we'll both sleep tonight
And I'll be dreaming till you wake me up
