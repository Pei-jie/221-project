rock
My song is love
Love to the loveless shown
And it goes on
You don't have to be alone
Your heavy heart is made of stone
And it's so hard to see you clearly
You don't have to be on your own
You don't have to be on your own
And I'm not gonna take it back
And I'm not gonna say, "I don't mean that"
You're a target that I'm aiming at
And I get that message home
My song is love, my song is love, unknown
And I'm on fire for you, clearly
You don't have to be alone
You don't have to be on your own
And I'm not gonna take it back
And I'm not gonna say, "I don't mean that"
You're a target that I'm aiming at
But I'm nothing on my own
Got to get that message home
And I'm not gonna stand and wait
Not gonna leave it until it's much too late, oh
On a platform, I'm gonna stand and then say
That I'm nothing on my own
And I love you, please come home
My song is love, is love unknown
And I've got to get that message home
