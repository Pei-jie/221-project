Outrageous! When I move my body
Outrageous! When I'm at a party
Outrageous! Wear my sexy jeans
Outrageous! When I'm on the scene
Outrageous! My sex drive
Outrageous! My shopping spree
Outrageous! We on a world tour
Outrageous! Let's be it girl
Sexy as I want to be
Got these fellas chasing me
It's 'bout time I hit the streets
All my girls still feeling me?
B-Girl ain't lost a beat
Jumped over drama, and I landed on my feet
Got to keep going, no stopping me
And if you don't like then
(La la-la la la-la la)
Media over here
Coming like world premiere
Trench coat and my underwear
Let's go with this freak show
It's outrageous! When I move my body
Outrageous! When I'm at a party
Outrageous! Wear my sexy jeans
Outrageous! When I'm on the scene
Outrageous! My sex drive
Outrageous! My shopping spree
Outrageous! We on a world tour
Outrageous! Let's be it girl
Outrageous!
I'm about to bring the heat
Locking down the industry
All dressed up, hair glamorous
Red carpet and cameras
Take trips around the globe
Tints on my jeep so nobody knows
So hot, got you coming out your clothes
And I'm about to give it to you
(La la-la la la-la la)

I just want to be happy
In a place where love is free
Can you take me there?
Somebody, ooh
And when you mention my name
Make sure you know the truth, yeah
Until I vow to keep it forever
