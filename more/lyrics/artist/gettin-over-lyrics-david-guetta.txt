All the things I know right now
If I only knew back then
There's no gettin' over, no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you
Wish I could spin my world into reverse
Just to have you back again
There's no gettin' over, there's no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you
All the things I know right now
If I only knew back then
There's no gettin' over, no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you
Wish I could spin my world into reverse
Just to have you back again
There's no gettin' over, there's no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you, no, no
Just no gettin' over you
Just no gettin' over you
All the things I know right now
If I only knew back then
There's no gettin' over, no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you
Wish I could spin my world into reverse
Just to have you back again
There's no gettin' over, there's no gettin' over
There's just no gettin' over you, no, no
Just no gettin' over you
Just no gettin' over you
Just no gettin' over you
Just no gettin' over you
