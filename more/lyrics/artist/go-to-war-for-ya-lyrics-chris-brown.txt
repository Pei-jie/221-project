Step one: I could be your man
You can call me daddy when we're f*cking in the sand
Step two: let's go for a ride
Better hold still, I'm driving
Step three: I'll be in the streets,
Throwing up the west side,
Checking up the breeze
And they can't take away my pride
They just can't take away my pride
...
Look into my eyes, and see what I see
You remind me of you and me
Chorus:
I'm ready to go to war for you
Ima be a warrior, Ima make sure they save me
I've been smoking that cali
And baby me and you girl
Think it over one more time
Yeah, just one more time
Verse 2:
Yo I'm just a little nigga from a small town
I try to keep a small circle, but the f*ck
Niggas social coming round (?)
...
You niggas writing bad checks,
I make your book bounce
I was riding in a limo
Getting down 24, got a bigger f*cking limo (Lamborghini)
Two doors up, now I'm two floors uá¹—
It's kill or be killed nigga
Either you or us
But I keep it moving like a U-hall truck
This adolescence, I be stressing, I be too f*cked up
But now what's the point of me having a crown if you ain't got a throne
You could be to me a queen, a throne
Look into my eyes, and see what I see
You remind me of you and me
Chorus:
I'm ready to go to war for you
Ima be a warrior, Ima make sure they save me
I've been smoking that cali
And baby me and you girl
Think it over one more time
Yeah, just one more time
Outro:
Yeah it would be one more time
One more time
One more time
One more time
Baby if we do it, it could change our lives
It's gonna leave us ...
Chorus:
I'm ready to go to war for you
Ima be a warrior, Ima make sure they save me
I've been smoking that cali
And baby me and you girl
Think it over one more time
Yeah, just one more time
Chorus:
I'm ready to go to war for you
Ima be a warrior, Ima make sure they save me
I've been smoking that cali
And baby me and you girl
Think it over one more time
Yeah, just one more time
