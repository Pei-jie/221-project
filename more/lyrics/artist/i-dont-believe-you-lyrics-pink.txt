Pink
pop
I don't mind it, I don't mind at all
It's like you're the swing set, and I'm the kid that falls
It's like the way we fight, the times I've cried
We come to blows but every night
The passion's there, so it's got to be right, right?
No, I don't believe you
When you say don't come around here no more
I won't remind you
You said we wouldn't be apart
No, I don't believe you
When you say you don't need me anymore
So don't pretend to
Not love me at all
I don't mind it, I still don't mind at all
It's like one of those bad dreams when you can't wake up
Looks like you've given up, you've had enough
But I want more, no, I wont' stop
'Cause I just know you'll come around, right?
No, I don't believe you
When you say don't come around here no more
I won't remind you
You said we wouldn't be apart
No, I don't believe you
When you say you don't need me anymore
So don't pretend to
Not love me at all
Just don't stand there and watch me fall
'Cause I, 'cause I still don't mind at all
It's like the way we fight, the times I've cried
We come to blows and every night
The passion's there
So it's got to be right, right?
No, I don't believe you
When you say don't come around here no more
I won't remind you
You said we wouldn't be apart
No, I don't believe you
When you say you don't need me anymore
So don't pretend to
Not love me at all
Oh, I don't believe
