[Chorus 1]
So whatever path we choose to take
There will be highs and there will be lows the same
Oh we''ll never run from our mistakes
The harder we fall the harder we try
[Verse 1]
Ain't it funny how we're all afraid
That tomorrow everything could change
We forget we gotta just enjoy the night that's right yeah
Ain't it funny how we're all the same
Different story for a different name
We forget we gotta just enjoy the ride tonight
[Pre 1]
So you oh you gotta live your life
True oh to how you feel inside
You oh you gotta live your life
Put your hands up buckle up and fly
[Chorus 2]
So whatever path we choose to take
There will be highs and there will be lows the same
Oh we''ll never run from our mistakes
The harder we fall the harder we try
[Verse 2]
Have you ever nearly lost your mind
Then realised it was a waste of time
Thinking bout all the things you can't control oh no, no
Have you ever nearly gone insane
Focusing on what you can't explain
It's good to know that I'm not the only one
Come on, say
[Pre 2]
So you oh you gotta live your life
True oh to how you feel inside
You oh you gotta live your life
Put your hands up buckle up and fly
[Chorus 3]
So whatever path we choose to take
There will be highs and there will be lows the same
Oh we''ll never run from our mistakes
The harder we fall the harder we try, again
[Hook 1]
Wo oh oh
Wo oh oh
Wo oh oh
The harder we fall
Wo oh oh
Wo oh oh
We'll just try again
Wo oh oh
Wo oh oh
Wo oh oh
The harder we fall
Wo oh oh
Wo oh oh
We'll just try again
[Chorus 4]
So whatever path we choose to take
There will be highs and there will be lows the same
Oh we'll never run from our mistakes
The harder we fall the harder we try
So whatever path we choose to take
There will be highs and there will be lows the same
Oh we'll never run from our mistakes
The harder we fall the harder we try
We'll just try again
