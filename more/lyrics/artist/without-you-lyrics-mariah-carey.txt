No I can't forget this evenin'
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way
The story goes
You always smile
But in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes it shows
No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there
But then I let you go
And now it's only fair
That I should let you know
What you should know
I can't live
If livin' is without you
I can't live
I can't give any more
I can't live
If livin' is without you
I can't live
I can't give any more
Well I can't forget this evenin'
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way
The story goes
You always smile
But in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
I can't live
If livin' is without you
I can't live
I can't give any more
I can't live
If livin' is without you
I can't live
I can't give any more
(No, I can't live)
(No, I can't live)
Nooo I
No no no no I
I can't live
(No, I can't live)
If livin' is without you
(No, I can't live)
I can't live
I can't give any more
I can't live
(No, I can't live)
