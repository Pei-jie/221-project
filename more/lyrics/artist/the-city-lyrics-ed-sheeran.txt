This city never sleeps, I hear the people walk by when its late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill, I can't close my eyes
Don't control what I'm into
This tower is alive, the lights that blind keep me awake
Hood up and lace untied, sleep fills my mind
Cant control what I'm into
London calls me a stranger, a traveler
This is now my home, my home
Im burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
Im blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
If the city never sleeps then that makes two
The pavement is my friend, it will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up and puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
And the shop across the road fulfills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls, I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow
London calls me a stranger, a traveler
This is now my home, my home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
If the city never sleeps then that makes two
And my lungs hurt and my ears bled
With the sound of the city life echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts but I need to move along
London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
If the city never sleeps then that makes two
