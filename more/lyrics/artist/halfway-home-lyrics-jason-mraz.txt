words & music by jason mraz
I used to walk along the opposite side of the road and made others get out of my way
I used to think I could sit and wait for the times
but they wont come until I meet them halfway
I'm halfway home and I'm on my own
I'm halfway there and I don't care, I don't mind
I plan to leave here after supper time
that's when traffic is light, all I need is a sign
and I'll be alright. I'll be fine
I used to think that i could just sleep and then I'd dream
And everything it would come to me
Until I woke one day without anything to eat
Lying on the opposite side of the street
I'm halfway home and I'm still out on my own
I'm halfway there and I don't care, I don't mind
Because it ain't my time to stay or say
I'll never lay down.
I used to think that I could just sit and wait for the time
But I know I gotta meet them halfway
I'm halfway home I tried home running with the flow
I'm halfway there. Ain't it funny how everybody seems to care
I planned to get there around supper time their serving up bread and wine
All I needed was a sign and I'll be allright.
I'll be fine.
(It seems to be a running theme about being fine and allright but I don't mind.)
