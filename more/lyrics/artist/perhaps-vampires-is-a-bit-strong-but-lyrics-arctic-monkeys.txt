Ive seen your eyes as they fix on me, what is he doing?
What on earths the plan? Has he got one?
You better give me some pointers
Since you are the big rocket launcher
And Im just the shotgun
Well, I aint got no dollar signs in my eyes
That might be a surprise but its true, said Im not like you
And I dont want your advice or your praise
Or to move in the ways you do and I never will
Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know youre certain well fail
Well I've seen you're eyes as they fix on me full of confusion
Your snarl is just so condescending
Try to explain that we're on to a win
If the fee we get in near recoups what we're spending
He said I can't believe that you drove all that way
Well, how much did they pay ya? How much did they pay ya?
You'd have been better to stay round our way
Thinking about things but not actually doing the things
Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know youre certain well fail
Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know youre certain well fail
All you people are vampires!
