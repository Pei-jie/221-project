I hide my pain like the rest of them
That's why I'm always laughing
I'm troubled, I'm brillant and miserable too
That's why I am so funny
I swallow down all my fears
With a bottle made of silver
I've only been here for 27 years
But already my life is over
And I need to unwind, yeah
I need to unwind, yeah
And I want all the time
To be loved to unwind
My life is like a fairytale
That nobody believes in
I can't remember anything
Not the people, not the places I've been
"Just one more day, you can make it, babe"
That's what I tell myself
And everything that I love in life
Is killing me, 'cause it's bad for my health
I need to unwind, yeah
And I need to unwind, yeah
And I want all the time, yeah
Love to unwind
Somebody comfort me
S-s-someone comfort me
Hey, hey somebody comfort me, hey
Somebody, somebody
I need to unwind
I need to unwind
Yes and I want all the time
I want to be loved to unwind
Yes and I live to unwind
Yes and I need to, yeah yea yea
I want all the time here to be
Loved to unwind
Yes and I need to unwind
Yes and I need to unwind
And I want all the time
To be loved to unwind
Somebody comfort me, ohh
