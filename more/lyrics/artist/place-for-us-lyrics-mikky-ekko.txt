There is a wall of silence in our way
What's quiet in the voices I cannot say
Through all the walls I fought in my mind
And your eyes are the only refuge I find
So we moved under the spotlight
And never thought about the price we'd pay
When all the world around us slipped away
Hey, is there a place for us
Where flames flicker and wave for us
And we can see the future and the dreams it's made of
Hey, is there a place
A place for us
A place for us
Well I'm not afraid to die here
But damned if I go on living a lie here
So long we revelled in the spotlight
And never think about the price we'd pay
When all the world around us slipped away
Hey, is there a place for us
Where flames flicker and wave for us
And we can see the future and the dreams it's made of
Hey, is there a place
A place for us
A place for us
Now from the streets we run
Eyes wild like the sun
We are the new creators
We are the chosen ones
And as the city blazes
You hear a voice that you can trust
Singing is this the place for us
Hey, is there a place for us
Where flames flicker and wave for us
And we can see the future and the dreams it's made of
Hey, is there a place
A place for us
A place for us
A place for us
A place for us
A place for us
