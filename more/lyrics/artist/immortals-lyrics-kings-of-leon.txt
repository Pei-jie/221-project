rock
The open road, the path of greatness
It's at your fingers
Go be the one that keeps on fighting
Go be the stranger
Just put your foot in front the other
Crow like the rooster
We are allowed to get us something
Fear is a danger
I say
Spill out on the streets of stars
And ride away
Find out what you are
Face to face
The windows are
The perfect picture
Theyre always changin
Go on get lost
Jump in the waters
when they are raging
I say
Spill out on the streets of stars
And ride away
Find out what you are
Face to face
Once you've had enough
Carry on
Don't forget to love
'Fore you're gone
Spill out on the streets of stars
And ride away
Find out what you are
Face to face
Once you've had enough
Carry on
Don't forget to love
'Fore you're gone
