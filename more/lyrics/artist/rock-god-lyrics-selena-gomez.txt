Preacher man walked into the club and he said he said: "Hey girl can't you walk and not stray?"
Father I'm torn and I'm selling my soul to the rythym, the beat and the bass
Cause' I can't confess my rock n' roll ways
(whoo) cause' I'm so posessed with the music, the music he plays
I can't stop my feet from dancin' to the sound of his drum
(Oh no) I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swayin' to his sweet melody
You see I fell in love with my rock rock god
Preacher man took my hand and looked in my eyes
He said "Hey girl, can't you live your life right?"
"Father things aren't always so black and white
Don't cast the first stone cause I'm not alone"
And its not like I'm hurting anyone (whoo)
But I can't confess my rock, my rock and roll ways
I can't stop my feet from dancin' to the sound of his drum
(Oh no) I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swayin' to his sweet melody
You see I fell in love with my rock, rock god
I can't stop my feet from dancin' to the sound of his drum
(Oh no) I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swayin' to his sweet melody
You see I fell in love withmy rock, rock god
No I wouldn't change a thing even if I could
Cause I chose a path and I'm not looking back
And I'm sorry if I left the angels crying
Over me
I can't stop my feet from dancin' to the sound of his drum
(Oh no) I fell in love with my rock god
I can't keep my hips from swayin' to his sweet melody
You see I fell in love my rock, rock god
Preacher man, preacher man,
Preacher man, preacher man, forgive me for I don't know what I do
Preacher man, preacher man, preacher man why don't you understand?
Preacher man, preacher man
Cause I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
(Have you never felt this way? Have you never ever ever, felt this way?)
Yeah, I'm gone
Gone (I'm so sorry sorry)
Gone (Oh no)
My rock, rock god!
