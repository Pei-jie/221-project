Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it that much easier
It might make it worse
Oh the night's like a whirlwind
Somebody's girlfriend's talkin' to me but its alright
She's sayin' that he's not gonna slap me or try to attack me
He's not the jealous type
And I only need to get half an excuse and I'm away
But when there's no excuses that's much easier to say
I've been before and all these capers makers too good for her to ignore
Well she's talkin' but I'm not entirely sure, ah
Do the bad thing
Take off your wedding ring
But it won't make it that much easier
It might make it worse
Oh, a sudden disheartener somebody's partner's talkin' to me
But I don't know that is what she isn't
She murmurs things to confirm that the tragedy is true
And I knew how could she not she could have anyone she wants
And I'm strugglin' to think of an immediate response, like,
"I don't mind
Be a big mistake for you to wait
And have me waste your time
Really love it's fine
Said, really love it's fine"
And then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy
I knew before the invitation that there was this ploy
Oh but she carried on suggestin', I struggled to refuse,
She said "It's the red wine this time, but that is no excuse"
