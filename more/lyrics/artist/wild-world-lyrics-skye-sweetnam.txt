Don't go, don't go
Please stay
Now that I've lost everything to you
You say you want to start something new
And it's breaking my heart you're leaving
Baby I'm grieving
But if you want to leave take good care
Hope you find a lot of nice things to wear
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile girl
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child girl
You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
And it's breaking my heart in two
Because I never want to see you sad girl
Don't be a bad girl
But if you want to leave take good care
Hope you find a lot of nice friends out there
Just remember there's a lot of bad air, beware
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile girl
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child girl
You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
And it's breaking my heart in two
Because I never want to see you sad girl
Don't be a bad girl
But if you want to leave take good care
Hope you find a lot of nice things to wear
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile girl
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child girl
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile girl
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child girl
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
