I Remember when we broke up the first time
Saying "This is it, I've had enough", cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you, said you, "needed space", what?
Then you come around again and say
Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change
Trust me, remember how that lasted for a day
I say, I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you
Oooh we called it off again last night
But Oooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never ever ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk
to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
Like ever...
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you, will hide away and find your peace of mind with some indie record that's much cooler than mine
Oooh you called me up again tonight
But Oooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never ever ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk
to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
I used to think, that we, were forever ever
And I used to say never say never
So,he calls me up and he's like, I still love you
And i'm like, I just, I mean this is exhausting, you know,like,
We are never getting back together, like ever
No!!We are never ever ever ever getting back together
We-eeeare never ever ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk
to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together getting back together, we
Oh, getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk
to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
