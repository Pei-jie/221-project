Cuz I put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby its keepin' me dry
I put on my raincoat, my yellow rain coat
Youll know exactly why
When the wind blows and the sun goes away
On the sinful, stormy day thats when its fine, thats when its fine
And as it pours down, the water sprinkles off my jacket slow, yeahjacket slow, yeah
Well never do I ever do I ever want this to phase me
Well never do I ever do I want this thing to make me
Cuz the fame and the money and the girls drive you crazy
And all the he said she said Im thinking maybe (just put on my)
Cuz I put on my raincoat my yellow raincoat
Baby its keepin' me dry
I put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat youll know exactly why
But as I look around, I see
Well nothing can't ever change me
All I gotta do is stay me
Let the rest do the work and Im sure that Ill be fine
Be fine
When the wind blows and the sun goes away on
A sinful, stormy day thats when its fine, thats when its fine
And as it pours down, the water sprinkles off my jacket slow, yeahjacket slow, yeah
