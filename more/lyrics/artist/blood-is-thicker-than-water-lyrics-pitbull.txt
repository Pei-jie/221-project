Pitbull
pop
I know y'all listen to my music
But what I'ma do now is I'm tryin' and describe my life to y'all
Sometimes I fell like I'm loosing it
My life is upside down
A gift and a curse that's my life now
There is no looking or turning back
I used to watch, watch turn to, turn to
That's what made me turn to rap
I feel like Keanu Reeves in the movie 'Devils Advocate'
Confused but blessed with extravagance
I thank God for all the opportunities
Given an opportunity, dem boys would put two in me
We live in the land of the free, hustlers and thieves
I made money, now I got uncle Sam hustling me
For a quarter of what I make
Hand a quarter sentence to a fake and watch them turn state
Blood is thicker than water, at least they say it is
Until the Fed's step in that's just the way it is
Most of these fools are characters
Men with no character, welcome to America
Where we fight for freedom
If it ain't about oil than we don't need them, ain't that the truth?
Pitbull, I'm just tell y'all the way I fell
Thank God that God made me to keep it real
Blood is thicker than water, at least they say it is
Till the Fed's step in that's just the way it is
Blood is thicker than water, at least they say it is
Till that fame step in that's just the way it is
Blood is thicker than water, at least they say it is
Till the Fed's step in that's just the way it is
Blood is thicker than water, at least they say it is
Till that money step in that's just the way it is
Yo, after the turf war, the smoke clears
All these years around these busta
I'm convinced there ain't no hope here
In the past four years of my lifetime
I witness leaders sacrifice freedom just to get this pipeline
Guess, I'm chosen at the right time, mama stress
Facing the table and she's snorting up white lines
Blood is thicker than water in a few cases
Your daughter can have touched for the money that in dem suit case
Tighten my shoelaces, the fugitive's running
In fear of a criminal past 'cause dem folks is coming
I've been wrongfully judged, being from this environment
The city gangs planning retirement, I'm a dead nigga
Voicing my set 'cause I spray quick
Took some of the same steps through little Haiti as these main ***
Hitman, Big Dogg and SheHound
Y'all predict it back then, *** I see it know
Blood is thicker than water, at least they say it is
Till dem Fed's step in that's just the way it is
Blood is thicker than water, at least they say it is
Till that fame step in that's just the way it is
Blood is thicker than water, at least they say it is
Till dem Fed's step in that's just the way it is
Blood is thicker than water, at least they say it is
Till that money step in that's just the way it is
I escape poverty, I don't own jewelry
Mother*** I own property
You can send dem Tsunamis that hit Indonesia
B-b-but ain't no mother, mother thing stopping me
Like good, good I'm a good swimmer
God knows I done lost but ***dam I'm a good winner
It feels great to make something out of nothing, yeah
I'm humble but I tell y'all to *** a Chico's buttons
And watch how them thing get to dumping
Real-estate New York game now you saying something
I only talk about what I know about
Illegal turn legal this year that's what I'm all about
I'm from the South and I ain't gonna lie
Fist time I preach ye, till God struck me with pride
I was confused now I'm like let's ride
305 till I die, 305 till I die
Blood is thicker than water, at least they say it is
Till dem Fed's step in that's just the way it is
Blood is thicker than water, at least they say it is
Till that fame step in that's just the way it is
Blood is thicker than water, at least they say it is
Till dem Fed's step in that's just the way it is
Blood is thicker than water, at least they say it is
Till that money step in that's just the way it is
