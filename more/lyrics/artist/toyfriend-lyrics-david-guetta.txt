I see you looking, yeah, you looking over my way
I'm gonna leash you up and put you into my cage
Teach you how to touch me, baby, how to say my name
Bet you never had nobody that'd give it you this way
I wanna put you in my closet
I wanna wait till I'm exhausted
I wanna come, come, baby, come
Be my toyfriend, let me play with you
Come, come, baby, come
Be my toyfriend till I'm through with you
Let me play with you
Let me play with you
Let me play with you
Let me play with you

Ain't gotta dress you up and put you on display
Rather keep you in my dollhouse
I'd turn you on, turn you on in so many ways
And I don't ever have to use no batteries
I wanna put you in my closet
I wanna wait till I'm exhausted
I wanna come, come, baby, come
Be my toyfriend, let me play with you
Come, come, baby, come
Be my toy friend till I'm through with you
Bounce
Let me play, let me play, let me play
Let me play, let me play
Bounce
Come, come, baby, come
Be my toyfriend, let me play with you
Come, come, baby, come
Be my toyfriend till I'm through with you
Let me play with you
Let me play with you
Let me play with you
Let me play with you
Come, come, baby, come
Be my toyfriend, let me play with you
Come, come, baby, come
Be my toyfriend till I'm through with you
