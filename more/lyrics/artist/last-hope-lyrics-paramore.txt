Paramore
rock
I dont even know myself at all
I thought I would be happy by now
But the more I try to push it
I realize gotta let go of control
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
So let it happen
It's just a spark
But it's enough to keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
Every night I try my best to dream
Tomorrow makes it better
And I wake up to the cold reality
And not a thing is changed
But it will happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
It's just a spark
But it's enough to keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
It's just a spark
But it's enough to keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
And the salt in my wounds isnt burning any more than it used to
Its not that I dont feel the pain
Its just Im not afraid of hurting anymore
And the blood of these veins isnt pumping any less than it ever has
And thats the hope I have
The only thing I know is keeping me alive
Alive!
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
It's just a spark
But it's enough to keep me going
(So if I let go of control now, I can be strong)
And when its dark out, no ones around
It keeps glowing
It's just a spark
But it's enough to keep me going
(So if I keep my eyes closed, with a blind hope)
And when its dark out, no ones around
It keeps glowing
