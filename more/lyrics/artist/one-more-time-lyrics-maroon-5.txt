Ooooooooh oh ooh ooh oh oh
Ooooooooh oh ooh ooh oh oh
You and I go hard
At each other like
We're goin' to war
You and I go rough
We keep throwin'
Things and slammin' the door
You and I get so damn dysfuntional
We stopped keepin' score
you and I get sick
Yeah I know that we can't do this no more
(Ehh)
But baby there you go again
There you go again
Makin' me love you
Yeah I stopped usin' my head
Usin' my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body
On my body
Like a tattoo
And now I'm feelin' stupid
Feelin' stupid
Crawlin' back to you
So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night
Try to tell you no
But my body keeps on telling you yes
Try to tell you stop
But your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be wakin' up in the mornin'
Probally hatin' myself
And I'll be wakin' up
Feeling satisfied
But guilty as hell
(Ehh)
But baby there you go again
There you go again
Makin' me love you
Yeah I stopped usin' my head
Usin' my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body
On my body
Like a tattoo
And now I'm feelin' stupid
Feelin' stupid
Crawlin' back to you
So I cross my heart and I hope to die
Yeahh yeahh
That I'll only stay with you one more night
Ohhh ohh
And I know I said it a million times
Yeahh
But I'll only stay with you one more night
Ooooooooh oh ooh ooh oh oh
Yeah baby give me
One more night
Ooooooooh oh ooh ooh oh oh
Yeah baby give me
One more night
Ooooooooh oh ooh ooh oh oh
Yeah baby give me
One more night
Ooooooooh oh ooh ooh oh oh
Yeahh yeahhh
Baby there you go again
There you go again
Makin' me love you
Yeah I stopped usin' my head
Usin' my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body
On my body
Like a tattoo
Yeah

Yeahhh
So I cross my heart and I hope to die
Ohh oh ohh
That I'll only stay with you one more night
Oh oh ohh
And I know I said it a million times
(Oh I said it a million times)
But I'll only stay with you one more night
(Yeah baby give me one more night)
So I cross my heart and I hope to die
