It's the assurance of things hoped for. Noah built a boat for
Jesus took a beatin and his whole body was broke for.
Spoke for. Through it we know who the Word was wrote for
[Sryan]
Abraham had it, matter fact that's what he's known for.
Faith, ya'll, through it we were saved by grace
If you got it, we can see it by the way you run the races
That means we can see it on your face
If the faith don't act, then it really ain't faith

[Imagine Dragons]
Before you heard "Breath In", "Represent! Get Krunk! "
I was tested in my faith, and I didn't know if I could jump
I was at my 9-to-5 try'na make a couple dimes,
But somethin in my soul was sayin that I had to rhyme.
I was rappin every saturday, teachin on Sunday.
8 A.M. again I'm back to work another Monday.
Man I was hatin it, I wasn't even fakin it,
And then came opportunity, but me, I wasn't takin it.
Show after show came; a couple folks came,
But leavin work to rap was risky like the dope game.
And mama mad at me, she say that it was bad for me
To spend my time in school just to rap, what a tragedy.
[Chorus]
Ya little sister is a (jump jump)
Even ya wifey is a (jump jump)
Ya baby mother is a (jump jump)
Uh huh uh huh
(Jump jump)
You know ya girl is a (jump jump)
Ya little shorty is a (jump jump)
I heard ya daughter was a (jump jump)
Yeah
