Girl, I gotta know what's up
Baby, what's your name? Can I get your number?
'Coz I wanna to talk about some things, yeah
Round 2, it ain't a thing
I was movin' every way you move, bobbin' and leavin'
Like your dumbo was supposed to do
It seemed like only yesterday that we did it
Now you want me like a fetish and I just gotta say that
Baby, you're a winner
It didn't even take you 12 rounds
To do it, you got to turn him down
I'ma tell the whole world
Give it up for my girl

Round 3, I can see me and you walkin' down the aisle
And I know we're young, so it'll be a while
But before we doin' that, but my momma got me in trainin'
Gettin' ready for the day when I'm make somebody happy
Said I was done with lovin', then I found some like you
Somebody tell me what I was supposed to do
You put my back against the ropes
No choice but to unfold, I gotta give it to you, baby
Baby, you're a winner
It didn't even take you 12 rounds
To do it, you got to turn him down

Girl, baby, I just can't believe
That every time you come around
I start losin' my friends, I'm trippin' over myself
'Cause you hittin' me, hittin' me
Oh girl, baby, it's so plain to see
That you got the best of me
So I'm throwin' in the towel
Baby, I bow out, let it breathe
Baby, you're a winner
