No matter what people say
I'm gonna do it my way
I'm strong enough and alive
I know that I can survive
Won't take advice that you give
I've got my own life to live
I'll make it right through the rain
and be the winner of the game
We're all winners of the game
Winners of the game
winners of the game
Winners of the game
One fight for glory
One life one destiny
Winner of the game
We've got one story
One life to be
Winners of the, winners of the
Winners of the game
You pushed to be what you see
on magazines and tv
Is it as hard as it seems
if you just follow your dreams
Is it truth or a lie
To work in safe till you die
Or this too, all insane
and be winners of the game
Winners of the game
One fight for glory
One life one destiny
Winner of the game
We've got one story
We all can be
Winners of the game
One fight for glory
One life one destiny
Winner of the game
We've got one story
One life to be
Winners of the, winners of the
Winners of the game
