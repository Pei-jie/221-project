Adele
pop
Still alive but no rest
Cold nightmares but no sweat
Her reality of her I can't stand next
To anything she shattered
Trying to swallow pain with no bladder
Steady rising from the feet with no ladder
Seeing death in the eye wouldn't matter
To only realize that when I gave a life
My love gave birth to the feeling that this was God's plan
Earth, wind and fire, powers of the lands
As we walked hand in hand
With the earth
But the sun cried
'Cause your talk for forever was your lie
Was it worth it to let me die?
I'm still standing from love's crime
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it burn as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it burn as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
A life in the world with no demands
A life of pride could never stand a chance
A flight I take to see a heartland
Every love deserves to see what truth can
Bring the light, no matter the dark fight
Dropping your hero, save it for the night
You told me what your eye touch, no iPod
Staring in your eyes with just no trust
Your mind has already been made up
When I see your soul but can't sense it
Reminiscent what we had was fermented
Drunk in my thoughts and vision
I close my eyes, the angels want me to listen
To my heart, the only thing that was missing
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it burn as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it burn as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
So many chances, so many answers
The reason we are far from advantage
The reason we go away to manage
The way we feel about love, about life
And all the things in it
I said it before, before the plan was written
Giving a life what it has given me
Would help you make this difference
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it burn as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it burn as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
