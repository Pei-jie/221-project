it's almost midnight, where you lay your head
but i'm calling numbers, buying plane tickets and bed
every channel on the tv, it's a wonderful life
i don't feel so wonderful on this cold winter night
i missed thanksgiving, missed a birthday or two
didn't make st. valentines, but i was thinking of you
only one thing in the world, i couldn't do
only one thing could kill me, christmas without you
ooh, the snow is on the ground
the day's getting colder, i'm coming home now
so go ahead light the fire, turn that christmas tree on
cause i've been missing you so much that i wrote you this song
yes, i did
i missed thanksgiving, missed a birthday or two
didn't make st. valentines, but i was thinking of you
only one thing in the world, i couldn't do
only one thing could kill me, christmas without you
only one thing in the world, i couldn't do
only one thing could kill me, christmas without you
oh, the presents wrapped, and 'jingle bells' on the radio
i'm turning down the street, there's no place i'd rather go
every holiday, oh, you feel the same
except for the ones when i'm with you
i missed thanksgiving, i missed a birthday or two
i didn't make st. valentines, but i was thinking of you
only one thing in the world, that i couldn't do
there's only one thing that kills me, christmas without you
