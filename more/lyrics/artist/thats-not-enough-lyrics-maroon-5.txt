She was a bad thing coming, but I did not know
And every time I came over she told me I had to go
I said, "Hey, what's going on? I really want to know"
She said, "I cannot tell you now, but I'll call you tomorrow"
That's not enough, I want more, I want it all
I want to bang on your front door
Turn off the lights and shut out the world
'Cause at the end of the day
Aren't we all just boys and girls?
Yeah, she's snake me with sophistication, so much class
She drinks a Santa margarita, would you like a glass?
I don't know how to say no, and after three or four
I was on the floor singing my song, la la la, no, no
That's not enough, I want more, I want it all
I want to bang on your front door
Turn off the lights and shut out the world
'Cause at the end of the day
Aren't we all just boys and girls?
Yeah, la la la, no, no
That's not enough, I want more, I want it all
I want to bang on your front door
Turn off the lights and shut out the world
'Cause at the end of the day
Aren't we all just boys and girls?
Aren't we all just boys and girls?
Aren't we all just boys and girls?
(All just boys and girls)
Oh yeah, oh
Aren't we all just boys and girls?
Aren't we all just boys and girls?
Yeah, oh
