A father waits upon a son
A mother prays for his return
I just called to see
If you still have a place for me
We know that life took us apart
But youre still within my heart
I go to sleep
And feel your spirit next to me
Ill make it home again
I pray youll fall in love again
Just say youll entertain the possibility
I learned enough from my mistakes
Learned from all I didnt say
Wont you wait for me?
It may be long to get me there
Feels like Ive been everywhere
But someday Ill be coming home
Round and round the world will spin
Oh, the circle never ends
So you know that Ill be coming home
We fight to stay alive
But somebodys got to die
Its so strange to me
A new year, a new enemy
Another soldier gone to war
Another story told before
Now its told again
It seems the wars will never end
Well make it home again
Back where we belong again
Were holding on to when
We used to dare to dream
We pray, we live to see
Another day in history
Yes, we still believe
It may be long to get me there
Feels like Ive been everywhere
But someday Ill be coming home
Round and round the world will spin
Oh, the circle never ends
So you know that Ill be coming home
Im coming, Im coming, Im coming
Im coming, Im coming, Im coming
You know that Ill be coming home
Im coming, Im coming, Im coming
Im coming, Im coming, Im coming
You know that Ill be coming home
It may be long to get me there
Feels like Ive been everywhere
But someday Ill be coming home
Round and round the world will spin
Oh, the circle never ends
So you know that Ill be coming home
