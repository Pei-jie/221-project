There's a boy, lost his way, looking for someone to play
There's a girl in the window, tears rolling down her face
We're only lost children, trying to find a friend
Trying to find our way back home
We dont know where to go, so I'll just get lost again
We'll never fall apart, cause we fit together right, we fit together right
These dark clouds over me rain down and roll away
Well never fall apart, cause we fit together like
Two pieces of a broken heart
I know where we could go and never feel let down again
We can build sandcastles, I'll be the queen, you'll be my king
We're only lost children, trying to find a friend
Trying to find our way back home
We don't know where to go, so I'll just get lost again
We'll never fall apart, cause we fit together right, we fit together right
These dark clouds over me rain down and roll away
We'll never fall apart, cause we fit together like
Two pieces of a broken heart
Now I can lay my head down and fall asleep
Oh, but I dont have to fall asleep to see my dreams
Cause they're right there in front of me
Right there in front of me
There's a boy, lost his way, looking for someone to play
We don't know where to go, so I'll just get lost again
We'll never fall apart, cause we fit together right, we fit together right
These dark clouds over me rain down and roll away
We'll never fall apart, cause we fit together like
We fit together like
Two pieces of a broken heart
Theres a boy, lost his way, looking for someone to play
