[Sean B]
You look at me
I can see
You through
What you do to me?
[Sryan]
Don't you break on me
I need you to stay
Right by me
What you do to me?
[Everyone]
You look, I watch
But I can't reach
Want to hold your hand so desperately
Aching for you to stop
Yearning for all that you've got
Looking at you is making me wanna
Feel this moment
[Evan]
I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
What you do to me?
[Adam M]
So I've come to complicate the dead
Are you with me?
I've written out all my vows again
What you do to me?
[Everyone]
You look, I watch
But I can't reach
Want to hold your hand so desperately
Aching for you to stop
Yearning for all that you've got
Looking at you is making me wanna
Feel this moment
You look, I watch
But I can't reach
Want to hold your hand so desperately
Aching for you to stop
Yearning for all that you've got
Looking at you is making me wanna
Feel this moment
[Adam E]
Just one more kiss to soothe the pain exists,
In a world of lies
Misery take my shame alive
[Adele]
Is it too late for saving me now?
It might be, baby
All I know is that this wont be
Last time that I let you down
But Im tryin, girl I swear
Some say hes something like a murderer
Love er, never heard of er
She aint heard of me so Im never holding a calendar
But she want me to watch how I handle her
But when you aint lookin you just live with the damaged
[Everyone]
You look, I watch
But I can't reach
Want to hold your hand so desperately
Aching for you to stop
Yearning for all that you've got
Looking at you is making me wanna
Feel this moment
You look, I watch
But I can't reach
Want to hold your hand so desperately
Aching for you to stop
Yearning for all that you've got
Looking at you is making me wanna
Feel this moment
[Sryan]
You look at me
I can see
You through
What you do to me?
[Everyone]
You look, I watch
But I can't reach
Want to hold your hand so desperately
Aching for you to stop
Yearning for all that you've got
Looking at you is making me wanna
Feel this moment
