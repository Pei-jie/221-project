I know you want, I know you want to take it slo-o-ow
Think about all the places we could go-o-ow
If you give in tonight, just let me set you free
We'll touch the other side, just give me the key
Zayn
'Cause we got all night, and we're going nowhere.
Why don't you stay? Why don't we go there?
Lets take a ride
Out in the cold air
I know the way
Why don't you go there?
With me
Liam
Say the word, say the word, but don't say no-o-o
Sky dive you and I with just these clothes-o-o
Your secret's safe with me, just don't write time or place. 'Cause anyone could see, through it anyways
'Cause we got all night, we going nowhere
Why don't you stay?
Why dont we go there?
Lets take a ride
Out in the cold air
I know the way
Why don't you go there?
With me

Just let
