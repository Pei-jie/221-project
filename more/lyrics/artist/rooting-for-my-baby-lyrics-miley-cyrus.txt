When you wake in the morning
And I can tell it's not your best side
No good morning, good day
I stay to the right if I know you're mad
And nonetheless, I stay out of your way
Just hold on
In a minute it'll be over and gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
I know, I know
That you go through a lot
I know, I know
The pressure makes you high
See I know, I know
Cause you still know what you got
I know, I know
Yeah
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
I'm rooting for my baby
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Yeah
You know, if you were here I'd get your beer
And I would hang your coat
You'd wanna be home
So you'd roll up your sleeves
And you'd sweat and breathe
This is a long road
So much more to go
Just hold on
In a minute it'll be over and gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
I know, I know
That you go through a lot
I know, I know
That the pressure makes you high
See I know, I know
Cause you still know what you've got
I know, I know
Yeah
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
I'm rooting for my baby
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Yeah
See, I've been dream-catching
I got that this is everlasting
Life filled with you, me, love and laughter
Happily ever after
So hold on
In a minute it'll be over and gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
I know, I know
That you go through a lot
I know, I know
That the pressure makes you high
See I know, I know
Cause you still know what you've got
I know, I know
Yeah
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
I'm rooting for my baby
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Yeah
I'm rooting for you baby, yeah
I'm rooting for my baby, yeah
That you go through a lot
The pressure makes you high
You still know what you've got, yeah
