Oh, no did I get to close or did I almost see
What's really on the inside
All your insecurities, all the dirty laundry
Never made me blink one time
CHORUS:
Unconditional, Unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
There is no fear now
Let go and just be free
I will love you
Unconditionally
come just as you are to me
don´t need apologies, know
that you are worthy
i´ll take your bad days with your good walk
throught the storm
i would, i do it all
because I love you
CHORUS:
I love youuuu
unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
there is no fear now
let go and just be free
I will love you, unconditionally
so open up your heart
and just let it begin
open up your heart
and just let it begin
open up your heart
and just let it begin
open up your heart
acceptance, is the key to be
to be truly free
will you do the same thing for me ?
CHORUS:
Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you, unconditionally
and there is no fear now
let go and just be free
cause i will love you
Unconditionally
oh yeah!
I will love you
I will love you
I will love you
Unconditionally.
