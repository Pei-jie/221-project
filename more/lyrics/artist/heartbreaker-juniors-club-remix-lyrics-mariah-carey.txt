Yeah
Give it to me like this
Aight, let's go
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Oh, you look so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I cannot resist at all
Boy, if I do
The things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby
Or leave me feeling used?
Would you go and break my heart?
Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
It's a shame to be
So euphoric and weak
When you smile at me
And you tell me the things
That you know persuade me
To relinquish my love to you
But I cannot resist at all
Boy, if I do
The things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby
Or leave me feeling used?
Would you go and break my heart?
Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
Okay, cool, aight
Yo, she wanna shop with Jay, play-box with Jay
She wanna pillow fight in the middle of the night
She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends
She wanna creep past the block, spyin' again
She wanna roll wit Jay, chase skeeos away
She wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my day
She wanna respect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find one strand a hair longer than hers
She want love in the Jacuzzi, rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib, keys to the newbie
She wanna answer the phone, tatoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to her mom
She call me, 'Heartbreaker' when we apart
It makes her wanna piece of paper, scribble down, "I hate ya"
But she know she love Jay because
She love everything Jay say, Jay does, and a
Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
