I never thought
(Who would have thought baby)
That I'd be
(Missin' you baby)
Without you
(I need you baby)
Why me?
(Why me?)
I never thought
(Who would have thought baby)
That I'd be
(Missin' you baby)
Without you
(I need you baby)
Why me?
(Why me?)
Love when your body next to me
On me actually, puff that ecstacy
Reminiscing how we used to smoke and freak
Fuck and fall asleep, knockin' for a week
Now we barely even talk and walk the block
Kiss and cuddle up, girl we're losing touch
What's a man to do but go crazy, babe?
I know you mad but you don't really hate me babe?
It's deeper than that, than that
If we got together again
Sugar I would be your very best friend
I would love you unconditionally
You'd never wanna let me go, baby
I promise I would be by your side
Would be everything you need to get by
Or my broken heart would finally mend
Darlin' if we were together again
Sometimes I close my eyes and just pretend
What if I had the chance to do it all again
Sometimes for happiness we hesitate
Just like the game I hear that love won't wait
But if I had another best friend
Well, if I had someone on who I could depend
Someone who makes me feel like you used to
Tell me baby what would you do?
If we got together again
Sugar I would be your very best friend
I would love you unconditionally
You'd never wanna let me go, baby
I promise I would be by your side
Be everything you need to get by
Or my broken heart would finally mend
Darlin' if we were together again
Baby, if we got together again
(Who would have thought baby)
Sugar I would be your very best friend
(Missin' you baby)
I would love you unconditionally
(I need you baby)
You'd never wanna let me go, baby
(Why me?)
I promise I would be by your side
(Who would have thought baby)
Be everything you need to get by
(Missin' you baby)
Or my broken heart would finally mend
(I need you baby)
Darlin' if we were together again
(Why me?)
Why would you wanna go through the pain of lovin' another man?
Truth is nobody can love you like I can
It's a damn shame, we can't get along
We used to get it on, where'd it all go wrong?
I admit the flesh is weak but the game is strong
You go my way, your way, baby, we moving on
It's true, I'm gonna miss you
Who woulda thought that I'd be without you?
I never thought
(Baby, there's nothing to lose)
That I'd be
(You know my soul's so cold)
Without you
(And my love is pain)
Why me?
(Baby, one more time)
I never thought
(My baby)
That I'd be
(Pride and joy)
Without you
(I'mma make you mine)
Why me?
(Without rule)
And if we got together again
Sugar I would be your very best friend
I would love you unconditionally
You'd never wanna let me go baby
I promise I would be by your side
Be everything you need to get by
Or my broken heart would finally mend
Darlin' if we were together again
If we got together again
(Who would have thought baby)
Sugar I would be your very best friend
(Missin' you baby)
I would love you unconditionally
(I need you baby)
You'd never wanna let me go, baby
(Why me?)
I promise I would be by your side
(Who would have thought baby)
Be everything you need to get by
(Missin' you baby)
Or my broken heart would finally mend
(I need you baby)
Darlin' if we were together again
(Why me?)
I would love you unconditionally
(I need you baby)
You'd never wanna let me go, baby
(Why me?)
I promise I would be by your side
(Who would have thought baby)
Be everything you need to get by
(Missin' you baby)
