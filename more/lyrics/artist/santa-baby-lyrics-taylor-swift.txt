Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree for me
I've been an awful good girl
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa baby, a '54 convertible too, light blue
Well, I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the boys I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'll check up my Christmas list
Santa baby, I wanna yacht and really that's not a lot
I've been an angel all year
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa honey, there's one more thing I really do need
The deed to a platinum mine
Santa honey, so hurry down the chimney tonight.
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring
And I don't mean on the phone
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight
