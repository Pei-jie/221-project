Now that I am thinking sober
Don't you try to get no closer
I'm just gonna get in my car and drive, and drive
Looking in the rear view mirror
Everything is so much clearer
Watch me wave it all goodbye, goodbye
The lights flashing giving me all the danger signs
Someone to save, to save
But it don't work that way
Think you made your greatest mistake
I'm not gonna call this a break
Think you really blew it this time
Think you could walk, on such a thin line
Won't be taking your midnight calls
Ignore the rocks you throw at my wall
I see it written on your face
You know you made it
Your greatest mistake
Your greatest mistake
Your greatest mistake
Your greatest mistake
When the last straw is broken
When the last door is closing
I ain't that dumb to stick around, stick around
Ain't got the time for looking back
You went and let yourself slip through the cracks
And you just keep going down, down, down
I'ma stay undercover, lay low, need some time
No one to save, to save
This sick cycle's over babe
Think you made your greatest mistake
I'm not gonna call this a break
Think you really blew it this time
Think you could walk, on such a thin line
Won't be taking your midnight calls
Ignore the rocks you throw at my wall
I see it written on your face
You know you made it
Your greatest mistake
Why you lookin' at me, spittin' the same old line
Tryin' to creep back
Ain't no flippin' my mind
Don't you get it by now
The story's over, over
Still callin' my name outside my house
I'm hittin' the switch
Watch the lights go out
Watch the lights go out
I hope you ache, ache, ache, ohh, ohh
I hope you ache, ache, ache, ohh, ohh
Think you made your greatest mistake
I'm not gonna to call this a break
Think you really blew it this time
You think you could walk, on such a thin line
Won't be taking your midnight calls
Ignore the rocks you throw at my wall
I see it written on your face
You know you made it
Your greatest mistake
Oooh. Oooh
