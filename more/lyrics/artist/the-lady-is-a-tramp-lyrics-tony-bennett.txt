She gets too hungry for dinner at eight (I'm starving)
She loves the theater but she never comes late
I never bother with people that I hate
That's why this chick is a tramp (hahaha)
She doesn't like crab cakes with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
And I definitely won't dish our dirt with the rest of those girls (thank you!)
That's why the lady is a tramp!
I love the free, fresh wind in my hair
Life without care
Oh, I'm so broke
It's oke!
I hate California, it's crowded and damp
That's why the lady is a tramp (I'm a tramp!)
Sometimes I go to Coney Island
Oh, the beach is divine
And I love the yankees
Jeter is just fine
I follow Rodgers and Hart
She sings every line
That's why the lady is a tramp
I love the prize fight
That isn't a fake (no fakes)
And I love to rowboat with you and your wife in Central Park Lake
She goes to the opera and stays wide awake (yes, I do)
That's why this lady is a tramp
She likes the green (green) grass (grass) under her shoes
What can I lose?
'Cause I got no dough! Oh, no?
I'm all alone when I lower my lamp!
That's why the lady is a tramp!
Go!
I love your free, fresh,
I love your handkerchief in my hair
Life without care (polkadot!)
But I'm so broke
That's oke!
Hates California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp!
That's why this lady is a tramp!
That's why the lady is a tramp!
