You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?
Oh the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had
Is just a memory and those dreams
But as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seemed
My love when you dream them all
Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she tells she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
Clinging to not getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?
Oh the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had
Is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem
My love when you dream them all
Oh, Flo, where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go?

You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
You were just sounding it out
You're not coming back again
