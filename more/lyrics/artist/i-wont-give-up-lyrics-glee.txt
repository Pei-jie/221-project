Hmmmm ... Hmmmm ... Hmmmm ... Hmmm ...
When I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
So much they hold
And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?
I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find
Cos even the stars they burn
Some even fall to the earth
We got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No I won't give up
I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use
the tools and gifts we've got yeah we got a lot at stake
And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
for us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not and who I am
I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
So easy is our life
What's mine is yours and yours mine
Hardly do we ever find
We'd rather be kind
I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get dark
I'm healing this broken heart
And I know I'm worthy
I won't give up on us
God knows I'm tough, I am love
We got a lot to learn
God knows we're worthy
No I won't give up on us
God knows I've had enough
We got a lot to learn
And we're, and we're worthy
No I won't give up
No I won't give up
