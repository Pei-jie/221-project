Knew where I was going
When you left the room
You're the kinda guy
Who makes me want to
Follow through to you
I've been trying to leave you
For the longest time
The second that I saw you
I just knew I found my right boy
I like it, I like it, I like it
I like it, I like it, I like it
I wanna crash, I wanna fall
I wanna be somewhere in the middle
Somewhere in the middle
'Cause something, it's better than nothing
I just need a little, I just need a little
And I don't wanna be nowhere
Somethings making me go there
Somewhere in the middle with you
I like it, I like it, I like it
And I like it, I like it, I like it
Losing my direction
That's the way it should be
Feeling a connection
When you're standing next to me
I wanna be rolling
I just wanna be rolling with you
All of the things you say
(I like it, I like it)
Its taking me far away
(And I like it)
I wanna crash, I wanna fall
I wanna be somewhere in the middle
Somewhere in the middle
'Cause something, it's better than nothing
I just need a little, I just need a little
And I don't wanna be nowhere
Somethings making me go there
Somewhere in the middle with you
Baby, you save me
Youre gonna take me from this [Incomprehensible]
Cause I just need a little, I just need a little
Somewhere in the middle with you
Crash, I wanna fall
I wanna be somewhere in the middle
Somewhere in the middle
Something, it's better than nothing
I just need a little, I just need a little
And I don't wanna be nowhere
But somethings making me go there
Somewhere in the middle with you
(Crash, fall)
I like it, I like it
Somewhere in the middle with you
(Crash, fall)
I like it, I like it
Somewhere in the middle with you
Middle with you
