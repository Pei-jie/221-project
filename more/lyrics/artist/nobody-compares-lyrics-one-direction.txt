(NIALL)
You're so pretty when you cry when you cry
Wasn't ready to hear you, say goodbye
Now you're tearing me apart, tearing me apart
You're tearing me apart
(ZAYN)
You're so London, your own style, your own style
We're together it's so good, so girl why
Are you tearing me apart, tearing me apart
You're tearing me apart
(HARRY)
Did I do something stupid, yeah girl if I blew it
Just tell me what I did, let's work through it
There's gotta be some way, to get you to want me
Like before
(ALL)
'Cause no one ever looked so good
In a dress and it hurts, 'cause I know you won't be mine tonight
No one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile,
Baby tell me how to make it right
Now all of my friends say it's not really worth it, but even if that's true,
No one in the world could stop me from not moving on
Baby even if I wanted to, nobody compares to you.
(LOUIS)
We're so Paris when we kissed, when we kissed
I remember the taste of your lipstick
Now your tearing up my heart, tearing up my heart
You're tearing up my heart
(HARRY)
Did I do something stupid, Yeah girl if I blew it

There's gotta be some way to get you to want me

(ALL)
'Cause no one ever looked so good
In a dress and it hurts, 'cause I know you won't be mine tonight
No one ever makes me feel, like you do, when you smile,
Baby tell me how to make it right
Now all of my friends say it's not really worth it, but even if that's true
No one in the world could stop me from not moving on,
Baby even if I wanted to,
