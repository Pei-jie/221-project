Gypsy, sittin' lookin' pretty
A broken rose and laughin' eyes, baby
You're a mystery always runnin' wild
Like a child without a home, baby
You're always searchin', searchin' for a feelin'
But it's easy come and easy go, ho
I'm sorry but it's true
You're bringin' on the heartache
Takin' all the best of me
Oh, can't you see?
You got the best of me
Woah, can't you see?
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
Can't you see? Oh
You're such a secret, misty eyed and shady
And baby, how you hold the key
Oh, you're like a candle, your flame slowly fadin'
Burnin' out and burnin' me, can't you see?
Just tryin' to say to you
You're bringin' on the heartache
Takin' all the best of me
Oh, can't you see?
You got the best of me
Woah, can't you see?
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
Can't you see? Can't you see?
No, no, no, no
Yeah baby, oo
You got the best of me
Oh, can't you see?
You got the best of me
Oh, can't you see?
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
