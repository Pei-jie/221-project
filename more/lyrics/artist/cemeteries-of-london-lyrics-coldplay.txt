Coldplay
rock
At night they would go walking till the breaking of the day
The morning is for sleeping
Through the dark streets they go searching to see God in their own way
Save the night time for your weeping, your weeping
Singing la la la, la la la ey
And the night over London lay
So we rode down to the river where Victorian ghosts pray
For the curses to be broken
We go underneath the arches where the witches there saying
There are ghost towns in the ocean, the ocean
Singing la la la, la la la ey
And the night over London lay
God is in the houses and God is in my head
And all the cemeteries in London
I see God come in my garden but I dont know what He said
For my heart it wasnt open, not open
Singing la la la, la la la ey
And the night over London lay
Singing la la la, la la la ey
Theres no light over London today
