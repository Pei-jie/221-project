[Verse 1]
You're feeling nervous
Having your doubts
Don't be embarrassed if you don't fit in the crowd
Keep standing tall and hold your ground
Show em it's not okay to let em kick you down
[Pre 1]
Oh oh oh oh
Don't let em ruin your time
Oh oh oh oh
It's now or never
Oh oh oh oh
Just let em know it's your life
So do it use it flaunt it, own it
Woo, that's right
[Chorus 1]
Yeah, you better give it everything you got
Hey, just show em you're a sexy lady
Yeah, you better work it till it's burning hot
Hey, just show em you're a sexy lady
Time is now baby
Look around baby
Just be proud
You're a sexy lady
Rock it out baby
Play it loud baby
Just be proud
All my sexy ladies
[Verse 2]
So admit it
It's feeling good
Your hips are rolling
And you love it like you should
Work up a sweat
Enjoy the ride
Good girl go get it
Wear your confidence tonight
[Pre 2]
