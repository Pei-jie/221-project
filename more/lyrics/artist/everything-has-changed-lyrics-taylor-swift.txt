(Taylor Swift)
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now,
know something now
I didn't before
And all I've seen
since 18 hours ago
is green eyes and freckles and your smile in the back of my mind making me feel right
I just want to know you better know
you better know
you better now
I just want to know you better know
you better know you better now
(Both)
I just want to know you better know
you better know
you better now
I just want to know you
know you
know you
Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name,
everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
is everything has changed
(Ed Sheeran)
And all my walls stood tall,
painted blue
But I'll take them down,
take them down
and open up the door for you
(Taylor Swift)
And all I feel in my stomach
is butterflies the beautiful kind
Making up for lost time,
taking flight,
making me feel right
(Both)
I just want to know you better know
you better know
you better now
I just want to know you better know
you better know
you better now
I just want to know you better know
you better know
you better now
I just want to know you
know you
know you
Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name,
everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
is everything has changed
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind
(Taylor Swift)
I just want to know you better know
you better know
you better now
I just want to know you
know you
know you
(Both)
Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name,
everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
is everything has changed
(Taylor Swift with Ed in background)
All I know is we said hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a newfound grace
All my days,
I'll know your face
(Both)
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
