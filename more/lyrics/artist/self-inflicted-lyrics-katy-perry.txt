Remember when I dove into the crowd
And I got a bloody knee under my skin
A mark from wiping out
It brings back the memories
Every bone's been broken
But my heart is still wide open
I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to
With each scar there's a map
That tells a story, what a souvenir of
Young love's like jumping out an airplane
Riding a tidal wave on an ocean of emotion
My heart rips me wide open
I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to
And I cover up these scars
We'll make it, we'll make it but we break it
And I can't stop seeing stars
Let's hope not die whenever you're around
Around
I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Oh, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to, oh
No, I can't stop
Oh, I can't stop
No, I can't stop
And I'm going out in flames
Oh, I'm going down in flames
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
