Chorus: Aaliyah]
I dont think they know the truth
Say they saw (A-A-to the L-I-Y-A-H)
I dont think they know, how could they know
I dont think they know the truth
Say they saw
I dont think they know, how could they know
[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Dont let them tell you any different
They dont know about us, they dont know about it
I owe it all to you
They dont know about us, they dont know about it
And as much as I messed up, always give me your best love
They dont know about us, they dont know about it
[Bridge:]
Sometimes I wonder what I did to deserve you
They dont know about us, they dont know about it
They gon talk about it (gon talk about it)
Gon try to change your mind about it
Gon tell you things you dont wanna hear
Cause we good. (Dont worry bout it)
So when they talk about (they talk about it)
Just let em know we already got it
Just tell em that we gon work at it, we good (Dont worry bout it)
[Chorus: Aaliyah]
I dont think they know the truth
Say they saw
I dont think they know, how could they know
I dont think they know the truth
Say they saw
I dont think they know, how could they know
[Chris Brown]
Dont listen to (How could they know)
What people say (How could they know)
They dont know about (How could they know)
Bout you and me (How could they know)
[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
At my best you love me
They dont know about us, they dont know about it
Even though I act my worse
They dont know about us, they dont know about it
And I know that its different, feels like were best friends
We connected
They dont know about us, they dont know about it
[Bridge:]
What did I do to deserve you
They dont know about us, they dont know about it
They gon talk about it (gon talk about it)
Gon try to change your mind about it
Gon tell you things you dont wanna hear
Cause we good. (Dont worry bout it)
So when they talk about (they talk about it)
Just let em know we already got it
Just tell em that we gon work at it, we good (Dont worry bout it)
[Chorus: Aaliyah]
I dont think they know the truth
Say they saw
I dont think they know, how could they know
I dont think they know the truth
Say they saw
I dont think they know, how could they know
[Chris Brown]
Dont listen to (How could they know)
What people say (How could they know)
They dont know about (How could they know)
Bout you and me (How could they know)
[Verse 3:Aaliyah]
How could they know x5
Thank you for the autographs
And the tears over the years
You still found me, you didnt doubt me
I think you want some more
I do more than sing
Im older now
Actin now
Cause I got my own movie now
After all the awards
That they gave me
You still found me
You didnt play me, you didnt doubt me
Think you want some more
I truly believe that if it wasnt all for you
I dont know what I would do
[Chorus: Aaliyah]
I dont think they know the truth
Say they saw
I dont think they know, how could they know
I dont think they know the truth
Say they saw
I dont think they know, how could they know
[Chris Brown]
Dont listen to (How could they know)
What people say (How could they know)
They dont know about (How could they know)
Bout you and me (How could they know)
