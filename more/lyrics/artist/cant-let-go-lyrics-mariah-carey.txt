Can't let go, ooh baby
Oh yeah
There you are, holding her hand
I am lost, dying to understand
Didn't I cherish you right?
Don't you know, you were my life?
Even though I try, I can't let go
Something in your eyes captured my soul
And every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I love, I can't let go
Just cast aside, you don't even know I'm alive
You just walk on by, don't care to see me cry
Here I am, still holding on
I can't accept my world is gone, no, no
Even though I try, I can't let go
'Cause something in your eyes captured my soul
And every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I love, I can't let go
Do you even realize the sorrow I have inside
Everyday of my life?
Do you know the way it feels when all you have just dies?
I try and try to deny that I need you but still you remain on my mind
Oh no, I just can't get you out of my mind
I never can say goodbye
'Cause every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I love, I can't let you go
Even though I try, I can't let go
Something about you that I need so bad
You're all I love
I can't let go
