Oh, how about a round of applause?
Hey, standin' ovation
Ooh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You look so dumb right now
Standin' outside my house
Tryin' to apologize, you're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out
Don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show
You really had me goin', now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closin', that was quite a show
Very entertainin', but it's over now
(But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow, oh, oh
Grab your clothes and get gone
(Get gone)
You better hurry up before the sprinklers come on
(Come on)
Talkin' 'bout, girl, I love you
You're the one
This just looks like a re-run
Please, what else is on?
And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught
You put on quite a show, really had me goin'
Now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closin', that was quite a show
Very entertainin', but it's over now
(But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow, oh, oh
And the award for the best liar goes to you
(Goes to you)
For makin' me believe that you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech, oh
(But you put on quite a show)
(You really had me goin')
Now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closin', that was quite a show
Very entertainin', but it's over now
(But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
But it's over now
