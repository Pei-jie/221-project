Pink
pop
Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it calling like a siren
Eh oh Eh oh
We dont want no problems
We dont like them, keep it movin
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens
Eh oh eh oh
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens
Eh oh eh oh
I just wanna play big city holiday
So get out of my way,
If you know whats better for ya Ooooh
Im tearin up the night, lipstick and leather tight
Not lookin for a fight, no
ehooooooo
High heels and cherry wine, not wasting any time
Were ticking like a bomb, about to blow
Eh oh eh oh
Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it calling like a siren
Eh oh Eh oh
We dont look for trouble
Just enough to seein double
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens
Eh oh eh oh
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens
Eh oh eh oh
Drink some Pink champagne
I dont know you yet
But well forget
So, fuck what they say
Let them run the floor until it rains
Im tearing up the night, lipstick and leather tights
Not lookin for a fight, no
eh oh eh oh
High heels and cherry wine, not wasting any time
Were ticking like a bomb, about to blow-oooh-oh.
Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it calling like a siren
Eh oh Eh oh
We dont look for trouble
Just enough for seein double
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens
Eh oh eh oh
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens
Eh oh eh oh
[Verse 3 - Eminem]
Yes, yes
Nothin high class in my glass, only bottles I pop
Are bottles of pop so when I pop up in the spot
Im prob-ably not gonna be wantin to pop bubbly
Or Ciroc, Im not Puffy, but Imma run this city tonight
When I hit it, I might act like a frickin idiot
Diddy mixed with a medieval knight, big city lights
Little indignity, hot diggity, this Biggie is gettin me hype.
I dont get some liquor, Ill hurt you!
Ill knock your dick in the dirt, bickerin worse
Than that bitch in that Snicker commercial
A mixture of Stifler and Urkel, hangin from the light fixture
I hope you pricks are insured for this buildin
Cuz were tearin it down, security get out
The frickin way, Jesus Christ son the blaring is loud
I swear the only thing I hear is the sound
Of sirens goin EERREERREERRRERR cause
Here comes the weekend,
Set off your sirens.
Here comes the weekend,
Set off your sirens.
Eh oh eh oh
Ooooh ooh oh
Here comes the weekend,
Set off your sirens.
Eh oh eh oh
Here comes the weekend,
Set off your sirens.
Eh oh eh oh.
