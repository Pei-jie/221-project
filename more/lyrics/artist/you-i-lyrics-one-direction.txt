[Verse 1]
I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time
I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight, like us
Did they ever fight like us
[Chorus]
You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it till the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above can separate the two of us
No nothing can come between you and I
Oh, you and I
[Verse 2]
I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
Cause they see your things in a different light like us
Did they ever try like us?
[Chorus]
You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it till the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above can separate the two of us
[Instrumental]
[Chorus]
'Cause You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it till the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above can separate the two of us
No nothing can come between you and I
Oh, you and I
You and I
We could make it if we try
You and I, You and I
