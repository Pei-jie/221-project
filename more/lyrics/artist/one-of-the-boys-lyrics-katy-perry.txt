I saw a spider, I didn't scream
'Cause I can belch the alphabet, just double dog dare me
And I chose guitar over ballet
And I'd take these suckers down 'cause they just get in my way
The way you look at me
Is kinda like a little sister
You high five your goodbyes
And it leaves me nothing but blisters
So I don't wanna be one of the boys, one of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be one of the girls
Pretty in pearls and not one of the boys
So over the summer something changed
I started reading Seventeen and shaving my legs
And I studied Lolita religiously
And I walked right into school and caught you staring at me
'Cause I know what you know
But now you're gonna have to take a number
It's okay, maybe one day
But not until you give me my diamond ring
'Cause I don't wanna be one of the boys, one of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be your homecoming queen
Pin-up poster dream, not one of the boys
I wanna be a flower, not a dirty weed
I wanna smell like roses, not a baseball team
And I swear maybe one day
You're gonna wanna make out, make out, make out with me
Don't wanna be, don't wanna be, don't wanna be
'Cause I don't wanna be one of the boys, one of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be one of the girls
Pretty in pearls and not one of the boys
