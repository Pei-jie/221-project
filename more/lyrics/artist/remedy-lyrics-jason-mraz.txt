[Verse 1:]
Well, I saw fireworks from the freeway
And behind closed eyes, I cannot make them go away
'Cause you were born on the fourth of July, freedom ring
Well, something on the surface it stinks
I said something on the surface
Well it kind of makes me nervous
To say that you deserve this
And what kind of God would serve this
We will cure this dirty old disease
[Pre-Chorus:]
Well, if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy
The remedy is the experience, this is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I said, the tragedy is that you're going to spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
Well, it all amounts to nothing in the end
[Chorus:]
I, I won't worry my life away
I, I won't worry my life away
[Verse 2:]
Well, I heard two men, talking on the radio
In a crossfire kind of new reality show
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack
Or they were counting down the ways to stab
The brother in the be right back after this
The unavoidable kiss, with a minty fresh death-breath
Is sure to outlast this catastrophe dance with me
[Pre-Chorus:]
'Cause if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy
The remedy is the experience, this is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I said, the tragedy is that you're going to spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
Well, it all amounts to nothing in the end
[Chorus:]
I, I won't worry my life away
(I won't, I won't I won't)
I, I won't worry my life away
[Bridge:]
When I fall in love now (I fall in love)
I take my time, there's no need to hurry
When I'm making up my mind
You can turn off the sun (turn off the sun)
But I'm still going to shine
And I'll tell you why
[Pre-Chorus:]
Because the remedy is the experience
this is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I said, the tragedy is that you're going to spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
Well, it all amounts to nothing in the end
[Chorus:]
I ('cause I won't)
I won't worry my life away
I (I won't, I won't I won't)
I won't worry my life away
I won't worry my life
I (I won't)
I won't worry my life away
(I no)
I ('cause I won't, I won't, I won't)
I won't worry my life away
I (I won't, I won't I won't)
I won't worry my life away
I (I won't, I won't I won't)
I won't worry my life away
