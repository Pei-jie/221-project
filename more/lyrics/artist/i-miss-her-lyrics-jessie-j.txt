[Verse 1]
It's not fair
I'm talking to you upstairs
Are you there
You know I care
So please don't tell me that this an empty prayer
Oh no
[Pre 1]
'Coz all she has and all she's lost
I wish she could remember
I watch her fade and slip away
It's hurting more than ever
[Chorus 1]
I miss her, even though she's still here
You need to listen
Don't let her disappear
I'll give her my forever
If it meant for a day she could really be okay
'Coz i miss her even though she's still here
[Verse 2]
Is this pretend
Will she really not know my face
In the end if you're a friend, a friend, a friend
Show me how to heal it
When she can't even feel it
Please show me
[Pre 2]
'Coz all she has and all she's lost
I wish she could remember
I watch her fade and slip away
It's hurting more than ever
[Chorus 2]
I miss her, even though she's still here
You need to listen
Don't let her disappear
I'll give her my forever
If it meant for a day she could really be okay
'Coz I miss her
[Bridge 1]
Promise me this, when she goes
Everything she sees will set her free
Thirteen and the colour green
Promise me this, that she knows
That the people that she loves
Will love her in the skies above
[Chorus 3]
I miss her, even though she's still here
You need to listen
So don't let her disappear
I'll give her my forever forever forever
If it meant for a day she could really be okay
'Coz I miss her, even though she's still here
She's still here
I miss her miss her miss her
I just miss her miss her miss her
I miss her even though she's still here
