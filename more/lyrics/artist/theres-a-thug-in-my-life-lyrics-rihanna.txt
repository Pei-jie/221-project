Gotta keep it on the down low
I'll never let my mama know
Only call him on my cell phone
Only see him after dark
I met him on the 6 train
Just the way he said my name
The brother had a lot a game
And he open from the start
He scoops me up in his ride
Friday about a quarter to 9
So fly and so fine
And I'm so glad that he's all mine
There's a thug in my life
How'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it ain't right
But he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna 'cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything
I know his crew is kinda shady
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady
Gives me everything I need
I don't care who's hating on me
'Cause every night he's waiting on me
He's got mad personality
A side they never see
My friends tell me to slow down
But every time that he's around
My heart don't lock down
I feel loved and I'm so proud
There's a thug in my life
How'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it ain't right
But he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna 'cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything
Mama don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry
He's the one for me, he's all I ever need
We'll be together from now till forever
I know it's the real thing, if you don't, whatever
And I know it's meant to be
There's a thug in my life
How'ma gonna tell my mama
She gonna say it ain't right
But he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna 'cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything
Mama don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry
He's the one for me
We'll be together
