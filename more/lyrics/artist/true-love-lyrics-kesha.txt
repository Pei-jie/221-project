Kesha
pop
I think about you all the time
One look, my knees get weak
Practically die
So hard to sleep
When i'm so close to this dream coming true
True, True
How do I tell, tell you?
When....
Chorus:
I can't speak
I'm terrified
Cause if I
Say the wrong thing
You might see how hard i'm trying
Is this made up
Or true love
Is this true love
Is this true love
Walk by and i'm a nervous wreck
The way you smell
The way you dress, is so perfect
My tonuge is tied cause
I can't translate these feelings inside ide ide
Oh
Chorus:
I can't speak
I'm terrified
Cause if I
Say the wrong thing
You might see how hard i'm trying
Is this made up?
Or true love
Is this true love
Is this true love
I want to tell you my secrets
I'll tell you everything
My heart is racing
I'm waiting for some time from you
How do I say it to my True Love (True Love)
Tell me you feel it to my true love (True Love)
Chorus:
I can't speak
I'm terrified
Cause if I
Say the wrong thing
You might see how hard i'm trying
Is this made up?
Or true love
Is this true love
Is this true love
