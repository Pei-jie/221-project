I try to picture a girl through a looking glass
And see her as a carbon atom, see her eyes and stare back at them
See that girl as her own new world
Though her home is on the surface she is still a universe
Glory God, oh God is peeking through the blinds
Are we all here standing naked
Taking guesses at the actual date and time
Oh my, justifying reasons why
Is an absolutely insane resolution to live by
Live high, live mighty
Live righteously takin' it easy
Live high, live mighty
Live righteously
I try to picture the man to always have an open hand
See him as a giving tree, see him as matter
Matter of fact he's not a beast
No, not the devil either, always a good deed doer
Well, it's laughter that we're makin' after all
The call of the wild is still in order nationwide
In the order of the primates all our politics are too late
Oh my, the congregation in my mind
Is an assembly selling gratitude and practicing their lovin' for you
Live high, live mighty
Live righteously takin' it easy
Live high, live mighty
Live righteously
And oh, let's take it easy and celebrate the malleable reality
Because nothing is ever as it seems, this life is but a dream
Live high, live mighty
Live righteously takin' it easy
Live high, live mighty
Live righteously, let's take it easy
Live high, live mighty
Live righteously takin' it easy
Live high, live mighty
Live righteously, let's take it easy
