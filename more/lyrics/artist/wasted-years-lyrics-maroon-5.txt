Slow is the memory
I can picture her standin' right in front of me
Orange blossoms crushed on concrete
I walk around with bare feet, 'cuz I know you want me
Can't remember anything
Her skin it tastes like sugar cane
And I had already gotten there before I came
My tank is empty and I know you're thirsty
But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to your cry, yeah
I'm sick of all these wasted years
A rag for someone else's tears
I wring you out as I hang you out to dry
No, no, no, no, no, no, yeah
And I'll see you when I get back
Maybe we can get ourselves back on the right track
You touch me there because you know how much I like that
I think that we will need to relax 'cuz I know you want me
All the time and everywhere
A happy surface but the underbelly isn't there
The worst thing is that I don't even really care
The emptiness is too much to bear
But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to your cry
I'm sick of all these wasted years
A rag for someone else's tears
I wring you out as I hang you out to
C'mon c'mon, get off the phone, please, come home
It's been so lonely since you've been gone
Your love surround me, up and down me
Be all around me, baby, I can't breathe no more
C'mon c'mon, get off the phone, please, come home
It's been so lonely since you've been gone
Your love surround me, up and down me
Be all around me, baby, I can't breathe no more
But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to your cry
I'm sick of all these wasted years
A rag for someone else's tears
I wring you out as I hang you out to dry
Sick of all these wasted years
A rag for someone else's tears
I wring you out as I hang you out to, to, dry
To try, try to get back home
Try, you try, yeah
