Take off both your shoes and clothes, I'll follow
Undo corkscrew, drink from half of a broken bottle
Lately we're running out of time, aren't we?
Smoking often and calling out our guilty pleasures
Let's keep talking anything to stop clockwatching
Lately we're running out of time, aren't we?
Crazy for running all the time, maybe, let's forget we're running out of time
I'm off like an aeroplane, I'm licking your postage stamp again
I'm using my right-brain and I'm praying that we don't crash
Who knew I'd come so fast
So what if a two pump chump can't last
But I made it to three and I foreclosed a five-minute fantasy
On a short lived flight, making love on economy
No jumping conclusions
I don't think there's no solution
Let's get backwards and forget our restless destination
Let's live in the moment just this time, could we?
Just take one moment of our time, maybe
Let's forget we're running out of time
I'm off like an aeroplane, I'm catching my second wind again
I'm using my left-brain and I'm righting all my wrongs
I'm yearning to turn you on
I've been working on getting you off, so get on board
But how can I guess by the subject of the best predicate that's left unsaid
When the matter is too delicate, my loneliness is evident
And it's you, you're running through my mind
And it makes me crazy, crazy
Ooh, it's so amazing
Lady dreamer, you might be the soundest sleeper
Tonight, sleep tight and build your nest upon my shoulder
