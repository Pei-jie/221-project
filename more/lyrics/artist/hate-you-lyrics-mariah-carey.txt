la la la.. ahh.. ahh.. ooh..

once upon a time, we swore not to say goodbye
something got a hold of us and we changed
then you sat alone in pride
and I sat at home and cried
how'd our fairytale just end up this way
we went round for round til' we knocked love out
we were laying in the ring, not making a sound
and if that's a metaphor of you and I
why is it so hard to say goodbye
I can't wait to hate you
make you, pain like i do..
still can't shake you off..
I can't wait to break through
these emotional changes..
seems like such a loss cause
I can't wait to face you,
break you, down so low
there's no place left to go..
I can't wait to hate you..
love is, was a love phenomenon no one could explain
and i wish, i could press reset and feel that feeling again
i sit and press rewind and watch us every night..
wanna pause it, but i can't make it stay
we went round for round til' we knocked love out
we were laying in the ring, not making a sound
and if that's a metaphor of you and I
why is it so hard to say goodbye
I can't wait to hate you
make you, pain like i do..
still can't shake you off..
I can't wait to break through
these emotional changes..
seems like such a loss cause
I can't wait to face you,
break you, down so low
there's no place left to go..
I can't wait to hate you..
uh uh uh..
no need to call my phone cause I changed my number today
a matter a fact, I think I'm moving away (away)
sorry, the frustrations got me feeling awake
and i just keep having one last thing to say
and i just wanna hold you, touch you,
feel you, be near you, i miss you baby baby baby..
I'm tired of tryna fake through, but there's nothing I can do..
boy I can't wait to hate you..
I can't wait to hate you
make you, pain like i do..
still can't shake you off..
I can't wait to break through
these, emotional changes..
seems like such a lost cause
I can't wait to face you,
break you, down so low
there's no place left to go..
I can't wait to hate you.. baby..
I can't wait to H.A.T.E.U.
Cuz right now i need you
I Can't wait to let you go
