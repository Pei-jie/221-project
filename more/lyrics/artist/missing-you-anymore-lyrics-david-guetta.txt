Yeah, you've fucked up for the last time
You think you got everyone figured out
We're living in a glass house

I'd probably do nothing to stop it
'Cause I won't be missing you anymore
Missing you anymore
Kissing you anymore
Missing you anymore
Touching you anymore
No loving you anymore
Is that what you really want?
Is that what you really want?

I'm tired of all of the nonsense
And if you were to leave now
I'd probably do nothing to stop it
Missing you anymore

Missing you anymore
Touching you anymore
Loving you anymore
Is that what you really want?
