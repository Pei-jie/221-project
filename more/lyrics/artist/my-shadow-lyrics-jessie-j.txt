You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
You'll never leave me
I wish we could have another minute
To finish this fairy tale
Hear your voice and get lost in it
Cause all I got is broken details
You were my world, and everything in it
So how did you disappear
I won't say this is over
You're still here
You're my shadow my shadow, i know you're close
You're my shadow my shadow, everywhere i go
so i, i don't see the need to cry, cause
you'll never leave my life
You're my shadow my shadow, whoa
you'll never leave me
you'll never leave me
you'll never leave me
you'll never leave me
I won't forget,
I just sit and reminisce
I promise I'll keep all your secrets
To have you back would be my only wish
cause nobody knew me like you did
the words would come to life
i've written in my diary
hide and seek but i know you'll always find me
count to 10 and I know you will appear
appear-pear, no fear, I'm here, here.
you're my shadow, my shadow, I know you're close
you're my shadow, my shadow, everywhere i go
so I, I don't see the need to cry cause
you'll never leave my life
you're my shadow, my shadow, whoa
You will never leave me!
Now you're gone I swear you won't be alone
My heartbeat tapping like it's made of stone.
I won't let you down
mute the sound
I can still hear, yeah
and now I'm breaking, see I'm shaking
but I know you're waiting yeah yeah
you'll never leave me
you'll never leave me
you'll never leave me
you'll never leave me
You're my shadow, my shadow, I know you're close
You're my shadow, my shadow everywhere I go
so I, I don't see the need to cry cause
You'll never leave my life
you're my shadow, my shadow, ohh
