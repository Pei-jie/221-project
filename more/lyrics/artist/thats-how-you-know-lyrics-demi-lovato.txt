How does she know that you love her?
How do you show her you love her?
How does she know that you really, really, truly, love her?
It's not enough to take the one you love for granted
You must remind her or she'll be inclined to say
How do I know, he loves me?
How do I know, he's mine?
Does he leave a little note to tell you, you are on his mind?
Send you yellow flowers when the sky is gray?
He'll find a new way to show you, a little bit everyday
That's how you know, that's how you know, he's your love
Everybody wants to live happily ever after
Everybody wants to know that true love is true
How do you know, he loves you?
How do you know, he's yours?
Does he take you out dancing just so he can hold you close?
Dedicate a song with words meant just for you?
He'll find his own way to tell you, with the little things he'll do
That's how you know, that's how you know, he's your love
He's your love
How do you know?
How do you know?
How does she know you that love her?
How do you show her you love her?
How does she know that you really, really truly, love her?
(That's how you know)
That's how you know it's true
Because he'll wear your favorite color just so he can match your eyes
Spread a private picnic by the fire glow, oh
His heart will be yours forever, something everyday will show
That's how you know, that's how you know
That's how you know, that's how you know, he's your love
