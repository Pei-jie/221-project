Baby, can't you see? I'm callin'
A guy like you should wear a warnin'
It's dangerous
I'm fallin'
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous
I'm lovin' it
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head
Spinning 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic?
It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from a devil's cup
Slowly
It's taking over me
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air
And it's all around
Can you feel me now?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do, but you know that you're toxic
Don't you know that you're toxic?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
(Toxic)
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?
Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
