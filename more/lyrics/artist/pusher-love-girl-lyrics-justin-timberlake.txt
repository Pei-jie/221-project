[Verse 1]
Hey little mama
Ain't gotta ask me if I want to
Just tell me, can I get a light?
Roll you up and let it run through my veins
Cause I can always see the farthest stars when I'm on you
I don't wanna ever come down off this cloud of lovin you
[Hook]
Cause now you got me hopped up on that
Pusher love
So high Im on the ceiling baby
You're my drug
So go and be my dealer baby
Give me all
Cause all I want is you, baby
One more time
Pusher love
So high Im on the ceiling baby
Youre my love
So go and be my dealer baby
Give me all
All I want is you, baby
Youre my little pusher love girl (Aint ya?)
Just my little pusher love girl
