Hey girl, whats up?
You've been going through it, huh?
Yeah, I know
And I know ya man ain't been treating you right
But ya man ain't me
Listen
Girl, I bet that he be actin' all cocky like
Like he deserves you and you so lucky to be with him
Bet he be treatin' you rude, always got an attitude
Like he's the only dude made for you, woah
But I bet he didn't count on, no like me comin' 'round
Giving you things to think about 'cause I know what's up
Since he ain't tryna step it up, don't you think you should give him up?
'Cause he ain't worth your love
Stop trippin'
I know you got a man but girl he's slippin'
I can see myself gettin' in where I fit in
I want you to see
Just how much ya man ain't me
'Cause he ain't fly, he don't even drive
'Cause when you wanna sneak out
In the middle of the night, baby, I'm your guy
I'ma reason he ain't being all that he can be
Baby please, ya man, ya man ain't me
Girl, I know that you be wishin' he was nothin' like
Like that playa type and you so lucky to be with him
Wish that he treated you cool and didn't cheat on you
Like you're just another girl in his crew
But I bet he didn't count on, no like me comin' 'round
Giving you things to think about 'cause I know what's up, yeah
Since he ain't tryna step it up, don't you think you should give him up?
'Cause he ain't worth your love, you need to stop trippin'
Stop trippin'
I know you got a man but girl he's slippin'
I can see myself gettin' in where I fit in
I want you to see
Just how much ya man ain't me
'Cause he ain't fly, he don't even drive
'Cause when you wanna sneak out
In the middle of the night, baby, I'm your guy
I'ma reason he ain't being all that he can be
Baby please, ya man, ya man ain't me
Can't you see?
You and him ain't meant to be together
Life with me will be better
Yes, let him leave
You'll be doing yourself a favor
Girl, I'm just tryna save you
Stop trippin'
I know you got a man but girl he's slippin'
I can see myself gettin' in where I fit in
I want you to see
Just how much ya man ain't me
'Cause he ain't fly, he don't even drive
'Cause when you wanna sneak out
In the middle of the night, baby, I'm your guy
I'ma reason he ain't being all that he can be
Baby please, ya man, ya man ain't me
Oh no, ya man ain't me, no baby
Oh no, ya man ain't me, no baby
Oh no, ya man ain't me, no baby
