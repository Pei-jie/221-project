I wanna hold 'em
Like they do in Texas plays
Fold 'em, let 'em hit me
Raise it, baby, stay with me
Love, the game, intuition
Play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked
I'll play the one that's on his heart
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh
I'll get him hot and show him what I've got
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll get him hot and show him what I've got
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
P-p-p-poker face, p-p-poker face
I wanna roll with him
A hard pair we will be
A little gamblin'
Is fun when you're with me
Russian roulette is not the same
Without a gun
And baby, when it's love
If it ain't rough it isn't fun
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
I won't tell you that I love you, kiss or hug you
'Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lyin', I'm just stunnin'
With my love glue gunnin'
Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, I promise this
Check this hand 'cause I am marvelous
I'm marvelous, I'm marvelous
I'm marvelous, so marvelous
She's got to love nobody
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She's got to love nobody
